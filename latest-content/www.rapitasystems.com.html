<a class="linktocontent" data-body="The U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development CommandÂ released a new version (Rev B) of AMACC, the Army Military Airworthiness Certification Criteria in November 2024.While the document presents the airworthiness criteria for US Army aircraft, there are some great lessons from the guidance that can be applied to multicore certification in a wider context, including A(M)C 20-193, and we thought we'd share them.Â A handy to-do list for multicore certificationThe most striking difference between AMACC Rev B and A(M)C 20-193 is the level of detail given in the guidance.Â While the objectives in AMACC Rev B are very similar to those in A(M)C 20-193, the former doesnât just list high-level objectives, it clearly lists activities too.Â A(M)C 20-193 specifies 9 high-level objectives and expects you to fill in the blanks of how to meet them. AMACC Rev B, meanwhile, presents no fewer than 163 individual requirements imposed on a wide range of deliverables for multicore certification. This enumeration of detailed requirements provides a concrete to-do list for certification, and as an added bonus, the guidance specifies where each part of each activity should be documented.AMACC Rev B includes a table-based representation of activities, clearly identifying in which document each activity should be documented (Source: AMACC Rev B)This detailed approach should be much easier for organizations to follow than the low-detail approach in A(M)C 20-193, especially for organizations new to the complexities of multicore certification.The detailed breakdown of activities in AMACC Rev B is very similar to that in the planning documents in MACH178 Foundations, which also includes procedures for meeting objectives, as well as handy checklists, templates and white papers to support multicore certification.Making things clearThe level of detail provided in AMACC Rev B helps in other ways too. Thereâs a lot of nuance in A(M)C 20-193, which may not be apparent the first time you read it. For example, A(M)C 20-193âs MCP_Resource_Usage_4 objective requires that multicore mitigations are planned for, verified and reviewed, but it only does so implicitly.This could easily be missed on a first read through the document and a first draft of multicore planning documents. This should be picked up at SOI#1, but if itâs missed, more effort may be needed to update plans after the certification milestone.Another example of how AMACC Rev B makes things clear relates to identifying interference channels. A(M)C 20-193 only specifies that this is needed at DALs A and B (MCP_Resource_Usage_3 objective), and not at DAL C. However, identifying interference channels is required to be able to characterize the impact of interference on hosted software, which is required for DAL C (MCP_Software_1). While this isnât a contradiction â the impact is that youâll need to identify channels but not need to include documentation of them in your submission â the guidance can confusing on this point.The additional clarity in AMACC Rev B really helps reduce ambiguity and should ultimately lead to more efficient certifications. This is obviously a good thing, and thatâs why we provided more clarity wherever possible when developing MACH178 Foundations, breaking down each objective into a list of sub-objectives that are individually actionable, and identifying where each should be documented in a DO-178C process.MACH178 Foundations includes guidance for developing A(M)C 20-193 certification evidence activities, breaking the objectives down into a list of actionable activitiesConclusionFundamentally, there is a huge overlap in the multicore objectives of A(M)C 20-193 and AMACC Rev B, but the latter is presented in a way thatâs much easier to follow. An itemized list of requirements, presented clearly along with expectations on where evidence is to be documented, can all help provide clarity on whatâs needed and when, even to an organization new to multicore certification.If youâre beginning to plan for A(M)C 20-193 certification, it may be a good idea to review the objectives and expand them into a list of activities reminiscent of that presented in AMACC Rev B. Or you could just use MACH178 Foundations, in which weâve done that for you already, as well as providing templates and checklists for each activity.

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="One of the unique challenges of working in the aerospace domain is the need to maintain onboard software for the long lifetimes of many aircraft. For both civil and military aircraft, software must often remain in the field for decades, during which time maintenance and updates may be needed to meet ever increasing demands.Â When such software is certified to DO-178 (DO-178A, B or DO-178C), MIL-HDBK (MIL-HDBK-516A, B or MIL-HDBKC) or related guidelines, this means verification environments must also be available for long periods of time.Â Â This can be particularly challenging when production and test equipment becomes harder to source and maintain. The Eurofighter Typhoon, for example, was developed during the 1980s and 90s.Â As decades have passed since the Typhoonâs launch in the early 2000s, the test rigs used for verification are now prone to breaking because of their age, and itâs becoming harder to source the MVME 135 &amp; MVME 136 (Motorola 68020) microprocessors that are used in the aircraftâs flight control and radar systems.Â One of our customers was looking for an alternative option to maintaining test rigs for verifying software running on the 68020 to reduce verification costs and derisk verification. From that need, Rapitaâs Sim68020 was born.Simulation and emulation with Sim68020The Sim68020 simulates the behavior of the Motorola 68K series of microprocessors, supporting execution, debugging, and verification of programs for 68K processors without having to use the real hardware.Â The Sim68020 produces branch traces that can be used to verify programs developed for the 68K processor for structural coverage analysis, execution time analysis and task-level scheduling analysis using zero-footprint RVS tools.Â While simulating the Motorola 68020 processor is a powerful first step, avionics systems are rarely that simple. Real-world embedded systems rely on a complex web of memory-mapped devices, custom ASICs, and communication interfaces. Thatâs why Sim68020 goes beyond just CPU simulationâit supports full-system emulation through a flexible and extensible plugin architecture.Sim68020 also supports a virtual RTBx interface, allowing seamless migration to on-target testing when needed. This means the same RVS integration can be used both in simulation and on real hardware, reducing duplication of effort and accelerating verification timelines.Sim68020 Demonstrates Autopilot Control in Microsoft Flight SimulatorTo demonstrate the full-system emulation capabilities of Sim68020, we integrated it with Microsoft Flight Simulator and ran a custom autopilot demo. The software includes basic waypoint navigation and a Ground Collision Avoidance System (GCAS).Through a custom plugin, Sim68020 connects to Microsoft Flight Simulator via a shared memory interface. This allows the emulated software to:Read real-time flight data such as altitude, airspeed, pitch, roll, and heading from the virtual aircraft.Send control commands to manipulate the aircraftâs ailerons, elevators, rudder, and throttleâenabling full control over flight dynamics and engine power.The demo autopilot software uses this interface to follow a predefined set of waypoints, adjusting course and altitude as needed. The GCAS logic monitors terrain elevation and aircraft descent rate, issuing corrective commands to avoid potential collisions with the ground.This setup enables closed-loop testing of control logic in a realistic, high-fidelity environment. Developers can observe how the 68020-targeted software responds to simulated weather, turbulence, and terrain, all without needing physical avionics hardware.By combining Sim68020 with Microsoft Flight Simulator, weâve created a powerful platform for demonstrating, testing, and validating embedded flight softwareâbridging the gap between legacy systems and modern simulation tools.ConclusionWe developed the Sim68020 to meet a specific need for our customer, and it offers a much more cost-effective alternative to maintaining expensive test rigs, especially as itâs becoming much harder to source 68020 microprocessors.Do you have a similar verification need for your avionics project? Let us know how we can help today.Â  " href="/blog/how-emulation-can-reduce-avionics-verification-costs-sim68020" target="_blank">

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="When making timing measurements of software, there are generally two classes of approach:Instrumentation-based approaches, where instrumentation is compiled into the code to make measurements, like that used by RapiTimeInstrumentation-free approaches, which leverage debug circuitry available in some processors to extract a branch trace from which timing information can be derived, like that used by RapiTime ZeroBut which is best?Figure 1. Overview of timing analysis measurement approachesA number of factors are in play, and each method has advantages and disadvantages. Let's explore them.Instrumentation overheadsA key concern when making on-target measurements of software is the overhead of making measurements. When additional code is being injected into the software to provide the instrumentation, this can add to both the size of the code and the execution time. This is a major disadvantage of instrumentation-based methods - there can be a significant probe effect that can perturb the software being measured. When injected instrumentation is used, care must be taken to ensure that the instrumentation isn't overly intrusive and doesn't cause an undue probe effect. This can place restrictions on the achievable granularity of the instrumentation.Conversely, using branch traces to derive timing information requires no instrumentation, and will usually have no direct effect on the software being measured. That's one point to instrumentation-free approaches!Figure 2. Instrumentation overheads for timing analysis measurement methodsTrace extraction bandwidthWhen traces are being extracted from a target, the bandwidth of the extraction mechanism is really important.Â When an instrumentation-based approach is used, the depth of instrumentation can be controlled to suit any bandwidth constraints on the trace extraction mechanism.However, when using a branch trace, the bandwidth required to extract the traces is driven solely by the frequency of branches in the executing code and the rate at which the code is executed.For a multicore processor executing at multi-GHz clock frequencies, collecting branch traces from multiple cores can very readily overwhelm the bandwidth of the trace circuits. Even for more modest multicore targets that are well over a decade old, this can be a real problem. Because there is no means of controlling the depth of instrumentation or bandwidth of branch trace being generated, the result of exceeding the available trace bandwidth is usually the branches are missed and the resulting trace is incomplete. This incomplete trace may be:So incomplete it's impossible to parse it.Parseable/recoverable, but missing branches at locations relevant to the timing properties we want to measure.Parseable/recoverable, but missing branches such that it's not always possible to tell which path was taken between two branches that weren't lost.Looks like that's a point to instrumentation-based approaches.Figure 3. Trace extraction bandwidth for timing analysis measurement methodsMeasuring resource usageWhen meeting the objectives of A(M)C 20-193 for multicore processors, it's necessary to measure resource usage as well as timing behavior. If instrumentation is used, the instrumentation can be modified to read performance monitoring counters, and this resource usage information can be encoded into the execution trace. When additional resource usage data are being collected, the bandwidth required for tracing will be larger, but this can be managed in the same way as when only timing data is being collected.Unfortunately, there's no direct mechanism to collect resource usage information from a branch trace. There are a couple of options to work around this, but both have significant drawbacks.It is possible to set breakpoints in some code when a branch trace is being collected. At these breakpoints, the debugger can be scripted to collect resource usage information and store this somewhere such that it can be combined after the fact with the branch trace to provide both timing and resource usage information. However, when there is more than one core involved, this depends upon the assumption that cycle-accurate cross-triggering between cores is available. In any processor that allows different cores to execute at different clock speeds (many do), the concept of cycle-accurate cross-triggering doesn't even make sense any more. Additionally, the assumption that the act of breaking and resuming execution has no effect on the internal state of the processor may not be true.The alternative approach to the instrumentation-free collection of resource usage data is using the debugger to periodically poll the performance counters while the processor is running. While this avoids issues related to breakpoints, it does mean that there is no direct traceability between the resource usage measurements and the code that was executing during the measurement. If a context switch occurs between two measurements of resource usage, it is not possible to attribute the resource usage to one task or another. Additionally, it may not be possible to make measurements of resource usage completely non-intrusively, and it also consumes additional bandwidth on the debugger (which may cause issues with the branch traces).Now that's instrumentation-based: 2, instrumentation-free: 1.Figure 4. Collecting resource usage information using timing analysis measurement methodsSumming upIn conclusion, there's no 'best' method of collecting results for multicore timing analysis - both instrumentation-based and instrumentation-free, branch trace-based approaches have advantages and disadvantages.An instrumentation-based approach is the clear winner when it comes to the flexibility of trace extraction, the control of the level of information being generated, and the collection of resource usage measurements, while the branch trace-based approach shines when assessed in terms of the measurement overhead.There are some cases where instrumentation is the most appropriate approach, and others where using branch traces will yield better results. Occasionally, it may be that using a combination of both methods can leverage the advantages of both.The Rapita Verification Suite supports both options: RapiTime is an instrumentation-based timing and resource usage analysis tool, and RapiTimeZero is a branch trace-based timing analysis tool. Rapita experts can help select the most appropriate timing analysis approach for your project. " href="/blog/multicore-timing-analysis-instrument-or-not-instrument" target="_blank">

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="To identify interference channels on a multicore platform, it is necessary to analyze technical documentation that describes the functionality of platform components. This documentation will generally be accurate, descriptive and helpful, but will likely contain some errors, omissions, contradictions and ambiguities. This might include missing or vague information about a feature or definitions that are in contradiction with the actual functionality. In general, issues can often be resolved or clarified through support from the vendor to enable continued analysis.Anomalies or errors are generally detected through on-target testing, and they are generally discovered when attempting to stress associated interference channels by targeted testing of a specific device or feature. A DDR interference channel, for example, will require tests to correctly miss L1, L2 and maybe even L3 cache. Depending on the architecture of the system, this may require using different datasets, strides through pages and access patterns.Performance counters can be used to provide assurance for the correct execution of tests to characterize interference channels. Their use can highlight unexpected behaviors due to deviations from expected test outcomes, which should prompt further investigation and analysis. In an extreme example of this, we discovered and reverse-engineered an entire undocumented cache, which of course had associated interference channels.

As such, we strongly recommend establishing and agreeing upon the definition and scope of what is required with your certification authority early in the process.When developing our MACH178 solutions, we have extensively discussed any terms in A(M)C 20-193 that are open to interpretation or are ambiguous (due to being redefinitions that differ from DO documentation, e.g., âDeterminismâ) with certification authorities and representatives and used terms accordingly in MACH178 Foundations.

Multicore systems are the future of DO-178C and ED-12C-certified avionics. With their increased SWaP characteristics, and the increasing challenge in sourcing single core processors, itâs inevitable that future developments will need to use multicore processors and have them certified.But therein lies the challenge â AC 20-193 and AMC 20-193 provide the additional means of compliance for multicore DO-178C avionics, but many questions remain; to state just a few of these:How should the guidance be interpreted?What methods can you use to achieve the objectives?How much effort is required?When do you stop testing?At Rapita Systems, we regularly deliver training and webinars on multicore certification in the US and Europe.

            The 43rd Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC) took place between the 29th September and 3rd October 2024 and we were delighted to present a paper titled Defining Quantifiable Measures for Data Coupling and Control Coupling with Collins Aerospace on Wednesday Oct 2nd, 2024.
    
    
            Authored by Phillip Hamm and Chris Hubbs from Collins Aerospace and Andy Galloway and Daniel Wright from Rapita Systems, and presented by Chris, the award winning paper is a case study on a cooperative research project between Rapita Systems and Collins Aerospace.Â 
            Â 
    
    

Chris Hubbs presenting the paper on DC/CC at DASC


    
            
            Using an upcoming tool being developed by Rapita, RapiCoupling, the two companies examined approaches for quantifying measurement of data coupling and control coupling (DC/CC). These verification analyses are mandated by DO-178C, but no guidance for quantification of these analyses has ever been published. The paper outlines the findings when measuring DC/CC on airborne flight display software and proposes quantifiable measures that could be used by the safety-critical software industry to assess the thoroughness of DC/CC analysis.Â 
            
            The paper is available on IEEE Xplore and personal copies are available on request from Dr. Daniel Wright.

          RTCA DO-278A / EUROCAE ED-109A is the main document used for the development of ground-based software systems that support aircraft operations. The document, titled âGuidelines for Communication, Navigation, Surveillance, and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) Systems Software Integrity Assuranceâ is the primary document by which authorities such as the FAA and EASA approve software used in ground-based systems involved in aircraft operations.

        Introduction to DO-278 &amp; DO-278A
        Design assurance guidance for aircraft software began with the release of DO-178 (ED-12) and later versions, DO-178A (ED-12A) and DO-178B (ED-12A). These documents provided the means by which software developed for use in civil aircraft operations were certified for use by the FAA and EASA.
        DO-278 was originally developed as a supplement to DO-178B to cover additional factors relative throughout the design assurance process. That is, the two documents were used together for approval of ground-based software involved in aircraft operations.
        DO-278A was released in December 2011. This document unified the guidance in DO-178C and DO-278 to yield a single document for design assurance of ground-based software involved in aircraft operations.

          Assurance Levels
          DO-278 introduced (and DO-278A continued to use) the fundamental concept of the Assurance Level (AL), which defines the amount of rigor that should be applied by the integrity assurance process based on the contribution to CNS/ATM system failure conditions. The lower the AL, the more activities and objectives that must be performed and met as part of the integrity assurance process because of the more severe consequences should the software fail or malfunction.
          
            
              The six ALs, which are summarized in the table below, determine the amount of rigor required in the development and testing of a specific piece of software.

            Planning
            DO-278A planning is the first DO-278A process that should occur and follows the basic design assurance principle that you say what you are going to do before you do it so you can ensure that what you plan to do will meet the required DO-278A objectives and provide evidence to demonstrate this.
            Development of a set of plans covering all components of the Design Assurance process is a cornerstone of DO-278A. As part of this activity, the following plans must be developed:
            
              Plan for Software Aspects of Approval (PSAA): a description of the software you plan to develop, the hardware environment it will be used in, the design assurance processes you will follow, and how you will demonstrate compliance, including how you will verify your implemented code and any commercial tools you will use in your verification.
              Software Development Plan (SDP): a description of the software development processes and the software life cycle that is used to satisfy DO-278A objectives.
              Software Verification Plan (SVP): a description of the verification processes (Reviews, Analyses and Tests) used to satisfy DO-278A objectives.
              Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP): a description of the methods and environment that will be used to configure all of the design data and compliance evidence needed to achieve DO-278A approval.
              Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP): a description of the methods and associated records that will be used to ensure that DO-278A quality assurance objectives are satisfied.
            
          
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          
            Development
            Development covers all of the activities that involve design and production of DO-278A software that meets system requirements of the project. This includes definition of high and low-level software requirements, software architecture definition and implementation of the software.
            Requirements should be developed in order to meet system requirements of the component hosting the software. These system requirements may be decomposed into hardware requirements (DO-254) as well as software components. Requirements should be verifiable as they will need to be verified in order to generate compliance evidence.
            The software architecture must be designed before the software is implemented. It is worth considering how the software architecture will affect verification efficiency as verification comprises a large proportion of the cost of a DO-278A project. Particularly, it is worth considering how your architecture will affect the efficiency of data coupling and control coupling analysis of your implemented software.
            Engineers new to DO-278A may be surprised at how small a proportion of overall effort Implementation takes in a DO-278A project, particularly at high ALs e.g. AL 1. As verification is much morwe effort intensive than implementation, it is worth considering how implementation decisions such as choice of language and language constructs used, choice of hardware platform and choice of compiler and compiler options will affect verification efficiency.
          
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          
            Integral processes
            DO-278A includes 4 Integral processes, which are followed throughout a DO-278A project. These are Verification, Configuration Management, Quality Assurance and Approval Liaison. Integral processes should be planned during DO-278A planning. Following the processes should generate evidence that can be provided to certification authorities to demonstrate that you have followed the processes you planned to (and agreed with the certification authority). 
            
              Verification covers activities needed to demonstrate that DO-278A software functions as intended. You will plan a Verification strategy in your Software Verification Plan and follow this after. Some Verification activities should be achieved by testing, while some are achieved by reviews. Software tools are often used to reduce the effort needed to verify DO-278A software.
            
            
              Configuration Management covers the processes by which you will control and track versioning of items developed during DO-278A projects, including software and documents such as reviews. Your Configuration Management process must generate a record of every version of every item, and these should be accessible throughout the project.
            
            
              Quality Assurance covers activities that demonstrate that you are following the plans and standards that you have said you will follow throughout a DO-278A project. This includes change control, problem reporting and conducting a conformance review to ensure that your DO-278A software and related documents are ready to share with your certification authority in the final Stage of Involvement (SOI).
            
            
              Approval Liaison covers activities in which you will interact directly with your certification authority, including the processes you will follow to prepare for and conduct the DO-278A SOIs with them.

          Efficient verification through the DO-178C life cycle
          DO-278A is almost identical to DO-178C, making this handbook a great starting point for understanding the DO-278A process and how to efficiently verify DO-278A software.

        Tool qualification
      
    
    
      
        As per DO-278A, you need to qualify any software tool you use that replaces or mitigates any DO-278A process and for which the output is not manually verified. The qualification process ensures that such software tools can be relied upon to produce appropriate and repeatable results.
        DO-278A itself describes when a tool must be qualified, but does not go into detail on how this should be done. The DO-330: Software Tool Qualification Considerations supplement to DO-278A expands on this guidance by defining corresponding objectives for the specification, development and verification of qualified tools.
      
      
        
          
        
      
    
    
      
        If you use any commercial verification tools to automate DO-278A verification processes and donât plan on manually reviewing output from the tools, they will need to be qualified at the appropriate tool qualification level. Many commercial verification tools have supporting qualification kits, which include evidence needed to demonstrate that the activities the tool developer must perform have been performed. All qualification kits should include all of the evidence needed from the tool developer. Some qualification kits may also include supporting material to help meet tool user objectives.

        The safety assessment processes used in all functional safety domains rely on demonstrating that the probability of system failure that could cause harm is below an acceptable threshold.
        When a system is made up of mechanical and electronic components, for which the component failure rate is known, the probability of failure for the system can be calculated and achievement of the safety target can be demonstrated. For software, complex systems or electronic hardware, system failures can be caused by design errors (sometimes known as systematic failures) as well as component failures, but there is no agreed way of calculating the failure rate of these design errors. In the aerospace domain, the agreed approach for dealing with design errors is to implement design assurance processes that have specific activities to identify and eliminate design errors throughout the software development life cycle.
        DO-178 was originally developed in the late 1970s to define a prescriptive set of design assurance processes for airborne software that focused on documentation and testing.
      
    
    
      
        Design Assurance Levels (DALs)
        DO-178B introduced (and DO-178C continued to use) the fundamental concept of the Design Assurance Level (DAL), which defines the amount of rigor that should be applied by the design assurance process based on the contribution to Aircraft Safety. The higher the DAL, the more activities and objectives that must be performed and met as part of the Design Assurance process because of the more severe consequences to the aircraft should the software fail or malfunction. Design Assurance Level A (DAL-A) is the highest level of design assurance that can be applied to airborne software and is applied when failure or malfunction of the software could contribute to a catastrophic failure of the aircraft. The activities and objectives that must be met through the Design Assurance process gradually decrease with each level alphabetically until DAL-E, which has no objectives as there is no consequence to aircraft safety should such software fail or malfunction.
        Objectives and activities
        The recommendations given in DO-178 fall into two types:
        
          Objectives, which are process requirements that should be met in order to demonstrate compliance to regulations
          Activities, which are tasks that provide the means of meeting objectives
        
        In total, DO-178C includes 71 objectives, 43 of which are related to verification. The number of these objectives that must be met for compliance reduces as the Design Assurance Level of the system reduces.
      
    
    
      
        Supplementary objectives and guidance
        DO-178C introduced three technology supplements to provide an interpretation of the DO-178C activities and objectives in the context of using specific technologies. The three technologies are Model Based Development and Verification (DO-331), Object Oriented Technology and related technologies (DO-332), and Formal Methods (DO-333). Each supplement describes the technology, defines the scope of its use within airborne software, lists additional or alternative activities and objectives that must be met when the technology is used, and includes specific FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) that clarify objectives and activities relating to the technology.
        A further supplement was introduced in DO-178C, Software Tool Qualification Considerations (DO-330), which gives guidance on the qualification of tools used in software development and verification processes. This guidance can be applied to any tools, not just those used for software development or verification, for example systems design or hardware development tools, and acts more like a stand-alone guidance document than the other supplements mentioned.
        Many other documents support DO-178C by providing additional clarification or explanations that can help developers to correctly interpret the guidance and implement appropriate design assurance processes. The Supporting Information (DO-248C) supplementary document includes FAQs relating to DO-178C, and the document is commonly referred to by the title Frequently Asked Questions. In addition to the FAQs in DO-248C, the document provides the rationale for the activities and objectives listed in DO-178C and includes discussion papers that provide clarification on specific topics related to software development and verification. A series of documents produced by the Certification Authorities Software Team (CAST) since the release of DO-178B provided information on specific topics of concern to certification authorities in order to harmonize approaches to compliance. These topics have had a greater scope than just Software concerns, and much of the content in CAST documents has been implemented in guidance updates such as DO-178C, or formed the basis of authority publications, such as A(M)C 20-193 to address the use of multicore processors in avionics and A(M)C 20-152A on the development of airborne electronics hardware. CAST has remained inactive since October 2016 and links to most previous CAST papers have been removed from the FAAâs website...........

Code coverage analysisâ¦ what is it and why is it vital when qualifying libraries? And why have Solid Sands and Rapita Systems got together to form an âAâ Team that will improve code coverage analysis on parts of the C++ standard library code that are traditionally invisible to coverage analysis tools?



First Encounters



The teams from Rapita Systems and Solid Sands first connected at the premises of a joint customer looking for large-scale coverage analysis for the C++ standard library implementation. From that moment, they started a strategic partnership that will allow them to maximize what they can offer in terms of safety-critical applications.



What does Rapita Systems bring to the party?



Rapita Systems develops on-target embedded verification software solutions for customers in the avionics and automotive electronics industries. They help to reduce the cost of measuring, optimizing, and verifying the timing performance and test effectiveness of critical real-time embedded systems for single and multi-core systems. The Rapita Verification Suite (RVS) minimizes the effort needed to verify critical embedded software for functional behavior (requirements-based testing), structural coverage and timing behavior.RVSâs unit, integration and system testing solution, RapiTest, helps engineers write and run requirements-based tests easily on host or target. RapiTest features easy-to-write and easy-to-review yet feature-rich test formats, as well as the ability to create multithreaded tests and test code elements such as generics and private types without having to write source code. The companyâs RapiCover tool provides the means to develop large-scale coverage analysis for the C++ standard library.



... and Solid Sands?



Solid Sandsâ raison d'Ãªtre is to inject quality into C and C++. They do this by improving the quality of C and C++ compilers, libraries and analysis tools and enabling their safe and secure use. Through the extremely high quality level of its test suites, Solid Sands makes sure it remains at the forefront of software testing and qualification to help users comply with functional safety standards.The company knows that analyzing code coverage is a significant challenge because the C++ standard library code has a unique structure. For example, not all analysis tools out there can trace coverage results back to the original library header file, so itâs not possible to see the library coverage of an entire test suite at a glance, only on a test-by-test basis. Also, Solid Sands understands that some features of the C++ language just canât be handled by any stand-alone analysis tool, so compiler-integrated coverage analysis tools are the way forward.Solid Sands is the first organization to attempt large-scale coverage analysis for the C++ standard library. This is challenging because significant parts of the C++ standard library are implemented by code evaluated at compile time. This essential feature of C++ aims to exchange run-time overhead for safety and speed of compile-time evaluation. However, this tends to make it harder to perform code coverage analysis because such analysis is based on recording run-time execution effects.







Two heads are better ...



The collaboration between Rapita Systems and Solid Sands will prove invaluable in developing and delivering solutions in this area. For example, together they will explore how the RapiCover tool can collect coverage of compile-time code to support the development of solutions that meet customersâ specific verification needs.By combining their expertise, this newly created 'A' Team is in a prime position to bring qualification of the C++ standard library for functional safety applications just an arm's reach away.

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="Software Data Coupling and Control Coupling (DCCC) coverage analysis is a required activity for DO-178C/ED-12C avionics software, and supports the development of high quality software by acting as an independent criteria for the sufficiency of integration testing. Â While DCCC has been a required objective and activity since DO-178B/ED-12B, there is still no universal approach nor clear objective guidance for meeting the airworthiness objective. At Rapita, we strongly believe that DCCC analysis should support the general objectives of your project, i.e. it should reduce lifecycle costs, decrease risk, and at the same time provide better confidence in the integrity of the product. In other words, it should provide added value, rather than simply being an unwelcome distraction purely for the purposes of certification.

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="The use of multicore processing in the development of critical software brings extra considerations and complications due to the impact of multicore interference on software behavior and required verification activities. This is particularly the case when developing multicore software certified towards guidelines and standards such as DO-178C/ED-12C and MIL-HDBK-516C, where additional airworthiness guidance should be followed (e.g. AC 20-193,Â AMC 20-193, orÂ AA-22-01).Your choice of platform components for hosted multicore software, including processors, RTOSes and hypervisors, can have a massive impact on verification effort, and itâs best to ensure that the platform components you use can enable effective mitigation of interference, and verification of software.

Aerospace Tech Week is an event that has been expanding the technology sectors that it covers since its AVIONICS origins in 2001. It now also synergistically covers CONNECTIVITY, MRO IT, FLIGHT OPS IT, TESTING, MRO, SPACE &amp; SUSTAINABILITY. Watch the Keynote address opposite from the recent event to see how this all fits together. Aerospace Tech Week consists of multiple events all under one roof with dedicated respected conferences tracks for its core technologies as well as a large central exhibition.

                        Multicore systems present certification challenges due to the impact of interference from software running on different cores reducing the predictability of behavior of hosted applications. This includes both timing behavior and software data coupling and control coupling. Identifying interference channels and verifying a systemâs ability to operate reliably given the interference present on the platform form the main thrust of the airworthiness guidance, but what does it take to do this analysis and verification?

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="...to solve the demand for C++ standard library coverage analysisSolid Sands and Rapita Systems announce that the companies have entered into a strategic partnership to develop ways to improve code coverage analysis on parts of the C++ standard library code that are traditionally invisible to coverage analysis tools.Due to a joint customer that required large-scale coverage analysis for the C++ standard library implementation, the companies were introduced. They now see possibilities to deepen their offering to the market of safety-critical applications.âTo the best of our knowledge, we were the first to attempt large-scale coverage analysis for the C++ standard library.â said Marcel Beemster, CTO of Solid Sands. âDuring this analysis, we found that significant parts of the C++ standard library implementation are implemented by code that is evaluated at compile time. This is an essential feature for C++, which aims to exchange run-time overhead for safety and speed of compile-time evaluation. However, this makes it hard to do code coverage analysis because such analysis is based on recording run-time execution effects.âSolid Sands, the world-leading provider of testing and qualification technology for compilers and libraries, reached out to many companies that offer coverage analysis solutions and found that, at this time, only some are enthusiastic about tackling coverage analysis for compile-time executed code. Solid Sands believes this is a safety-critical feature.Antoine Colin, CTO of Rapita Systems said, âAs the safety-critical industry evolves to use more modern programming features, it is crucial that verification tools keep up with the pace and support these features. We are delighted to work with Solid Sands to achieve this aim by exploring how RapiCover can collect coverage of compile-time code to support the development of Solid Sandsâ solutions and our customersâ verification needs.âRapita Systems is an international company that develops on-target embedded verification software solutions for customers in the avionics and automotive electronics industries. Their tool RapiCover is now used to jointly look for ways to perform large-scale coverage analysis for the complete C++ standard library.For Solid Sands, this collaboration comes just in time as they are working on launching SuperGuard for C++ at the end of 2023.Â  " href="/news/solid-sands-partners-rapita-systems" target="_blank">

            Presentation by Dr. Sam Thompson, May 12th 10:10 - 10:45
        
        
            Dr. Sam Thompson will be presenting on Day 3 of the event on the topic of 'Certifying Multicore avionics systems according to DO-178C guidance'.
        
        
            The avionics industry is moving towards the use of multicore systems to meet the demands of modern avionics applications. To use these systems in mission or safety-critical contexts, their âworst-caseâ timing behavior must be verified for DO-178C certification. The FAA published the CAST-32A position paper in 2016, in which they identified topics that could impact the safety, performance and integrity of multicore processors and suggested additional objectives that could be met to provide design assurance for multicore DO-178C software. This advice has been formalized by the FAA in AC 20-193 and by EASA in AMC 20-193. Existing techniques to verify software timing behavior are unsuitable to analyze multicore systems as they do not consider interference effects caused by contention for shared resources, which can have significant effects on software timing behavior and are often only discovered when analyzing a system in-depth. We describe our MACH-178 approach to characterization of multicore systems, identification of interference channels, and the production of certification evidence for hosted software. The approach is designed to be reproducible, automatable, scalable, and produces reusable outputs. This can yield large efficiency savings, particularly in large and complex projects where components may be deployed several times, or where frequent iterations of software need re-certification.

Multicore systems are being used more in critical avionics systems due to their improved SWaP characteristics, increasing need for performance, and decreasing availability of single core processors. The use of these systems presents certification challenges due to the impact of interference from software running on different cores reducing the predictability of timing behavior of hosted applications. A(M)C 20-193 guidance for DO-178C/ED-12C lists additional objectives that must be met for certification of multicore systems.

We outline future challenges of A(M)C 20-193 certification and present a robust, efficient approach to meeting A(M)C 20-193 objectives, which is being adopted by aerospace avionics developers across the globe. The approach improves efficiency across the DO-178C life cycle, supporting the evaluation of multicore architectures, DO-178C planning for multicore software aspects, analysis of interference channels, and verification that hosted applications meet their timing deadlines even when interference is present.

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="The avionics industry is moving more and more towards the use of multicore platforms and applications. While this presents benefits in terms of improved performance, it also presents challenges in terms of meeting specific multicore guidance A(M)C 20-193 and CAST-32A. A major obstacle in meeting this guidance is understanding and quantifying the impact of interference on platform and application behavior. Various strategies are available to mitigate interference from board and chip manufacturers and RTOS vendors. When these strategies are used, their effectiveness must be verified.

For single core systems, it is relatively straightforward to analyze software timing behavior and put an upper bound on the systemâs worst-case timing behavior. For multicore systems, however, this is more challenging. Contention for shared resources such as caches, buses and interconnects in a multicore system increase non-determinism in timing behavior, as the timing behavior of an application accessing a shared resource may depend on whether or not other cores are simultaneously trying to access the same resource, and this isnât necessarily known. Effects leading to this non-determinism are known as interference, and the channels through which they occur (e.g. a particular shared cache) are known as interference channels (Figure 1).


Â 




Figure 1. Interference can result from resources used by different cores in a multicore system.



Â 


To comply with A(M)C 20-193 objectives, all interference channels in a system must be considered. Interference channels can be direct (obvious), indirect (non-obvious/obscure), or unknown (undocumented channels that must be discovered). Some channels can be mitigated (either fully or partially) by disabling hardware, imposing constraints on the design (for instance, cache partitioning), or using run-time protection mechanisms (for example bandwidth monitoring or fine-grained locking). Cache partitioning, for example,Â provides protection from one core/partition evicting the other by making sure no two cores/partitions use the same section of the cache (Figure 2).


Â 




Figure 2. The cache partitioning approach to mitigating multicore interference.



Â 


While mitigation mechanisms can help reduce required verification effort, verification is still required regardless of which mitigation mechanism is used (MCP_Resource_Usage_3, Figure 3). For example, when an interference channel is fully mitigated by disabling a component, verification is needed to demonstrate that the component is disabled and remains disabled while the software is running. When an interference channel is partially mitigated by design or through run-time protection mechanisms, the effectiveness of the mitigations must be verified to demonstrate that the interference is within acceptable bounds.




Figure 3. Interference channels â identification, mitigation and verification. The distribution of different types of channels and the distribution of mitigation methods applied to those channels varies depending on the multicore platform and how it is configured.



After interference channels have been understood and mitigation mechanisms verified, software timing behavior must be analyzed (Figure 3). This must be done in the context of any interference channels that are active in the system (even channels that have been partially mitigated).

Specialist expertise and technology is needed to identify interference channels, verify the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, and analyze execution time behavior for multicore systems in line with A(M)C 20-193 objectives. Rapitaâs MACH178 solution supports this end-to-end.

Multicore processors are being used more and more in the development of critical embedded electronics, including avionics and automotive electronics. This is due to increasing demands on application functionality, the improved SWaP (size, weight and power) characteristics of these processors, and the increasing difficulty in sourcing single core processors.
One of the main challenges in the adoption of multicore processors in critical electronics systems is that software running on one core can affect the execution of software running on another core. Multicore platforms are inherently non-deterministic with regards to their timing behavior, which poses a challenge for certification e.g. in accordance with DO-178C and AC 20-193,Â AMC 20-193 or CAST-32A guidance for aerospace software. Platform features that contribute to non-determinism are known as interference channels (Figure 1). These features can affect the ability of hosted software to meet its requirements. Some interference channels are obvious, but others are a little harder to identify. In this post, we discuss some of the better and less well-known sources of interference in multicore systems, using the NXPÂ® T2080 processor as an example.

  Â 
  
    
      
        
      
      Figure 1. Interference can result from resources used by different cores in a multicore system
    
  
  Â 

Types of interference
Interference channels can be classified in three categories: direct, indirect, and unknown.
Examples of direct interference channels include shared on-chip resources such as shared caches, buses and memory management units, and off-chip resources such as I/O devices. Each shared resource may have multiple interference channels associated with it. The T2080 features an L2 cache that is shared across the four e6500 cores (Figure 2). Examples of direct interference channels relating to the L2 cache include one core causing the eviction of another coreâs data from the cache, and the L2 cache having a limited bandwidth that is saturated by the four cores accessing the cache simultaneously. 

  Â 
  
    
      
        
      
      Figure 2. NXP T2080 board architecture (image used with permission from NXP)
    
  
  Â 

An example of an indirect interference channel on the T2080 is the potential slowdown induced by an excess of snoop requests on private caches due to cache coherency operations (Figure 3). Cache coherency is a mechanism by which shared data that gets loaded in private caches is updated to ensure that it is consistent with the data in main memory (depending on the configuration of the cache). Typically, when a core accesses shared data, the cache coherency mechanism will trigger snoop requests in order to detect any data in caches that needs to be invalidated. 

  Â 
  
    
      
        
      
      Figure 3. Snoop requests by cache coherency mechanisms are an example of indirect interference channels
    
  
  Â 


  Unknown interference channels are typically due to undocumented platform features. An example of these could be differences in the coreâs performance and/or sensitivity to multicore interference due to the physical memory layout.

Identifying interference channels
The interference channels present in a platform depend on the chip and board architecture, the critical configuration settings of the system, which off-chip devices are being used, and how they are being used. For DO-178C certification in line with AC 20,193 or AMC 20-193 guidance, all the active interference channels in a multicore system must be identified and considered.
Identifying the potential interference channels in a specific system requires access to be available to comprehensive documentation describing multicore hardware from board and chip manufacturers and RTOS vendors, and the input of specialized engineers. The number of interference channels in a multicore system may be larger than youâd expect â having run a few projects involving the T2080, weâve identified more than 150 potential interference channels on this system, depending on the configuration settings and peripherals used.

Ever been frustrated with software licensing? Most of us have. Good software licensing shouldnât be prohibitive, it should make your life easier and help you work in the way that you and your organization prefer. In this blog, weâll explore how you can benefit from Rapita Verification SuiteÂ (RVS)âs flexible licensing policies, which are designed to support you in whichever way you work.

Introduction

Working practices have changed considerably in recent years, particularly as a result of COVID-19 measures. Probably the biggest shift has been in the number of people working remotely (from home or elsewhere), and this is as true in the embedded software industry as it is elsewhere. Modern software development practices such as testing via continuous integration frameworks have also contributed to the need for innovative approaches to licensing. Our RVS licensing policies emphasize flexibility that helps facilitate how you work.

Supporting you working wherever you are



Itâs crucial that engineers can use the tools that are critical to their day-to-day software development and testing activities flexibly from locations beyond their companyâs office. Our floating Enterprise licenses are not geographically restricted, allowing engineers to use the Rapita Verification Suite from home or the office.


 Working from home is becoming more common


This geographical flexibility extends beyond the office and even beyond borders. For example, we have customers who have headquarters on one continent but other offices across the world. With RVS licensing, colleagues from across the world can access licenses from a central enterprise server pool. Not only is this convenient, it also often means that international companies donât need to purchase as many licenses to support their use of RVS.

Providing flexibility throughout your license lifecycle

As standard licensing policy, we provide customers with flexibility in how they use RVS in other ways with advanced licensing features such as:


	Unnamed license seats enable our customers to use licenses flexibly between machines and users. Instead of limiting users, we limit the total number of concurrent instances of RVS running. This means that licensing costs are based on the amount you're using RVS, rather than the number of users registered to use the software.
	License grouping to let you define how and where your licenses can be used. After setting up groups, you can assign specific users, hostnames or IP addresses to each group, and you can manage these settings at any time. This can help you ensure, for example, that different geographical locations within your organization have a minimum guaranteed number of licenses available at any time. It also lets you support licensing use cases such as reserving licenses for your continuous integration servers so licenses are always available for them.
	License transfers to let you transfer a set of licenses from one license server to another. This supports situations such as temporary projects, reducing latency by transferring licenses from global to local servers, and sharing licenses with subcontracting organizations. Transferring existing licenses to a subcontracting organization (for example an organization providing third-party verification services) as in the latter example can reduce both licensing costs and licensing setup time.
	Roaming licenses to let you allocate a license to a system that will be disconnected from the network so RVS can be used when the system is offline.
	Failover license servers to provide the capability for a license server to take over the licenses managed by another server if it goes down.

Exceptional measures for exceptional times

The flexibility weâve described so far is our standard to help RVS users work in different, but expected, ways. We are also pro-active when unforeseeable, urgent situations arise. In a recent example of this, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we ensured that our customers could continue to use RVS from their new home working environments by letting them connect to our public license server instead/as well as their internal license server. This temporary measure allowed our customers to use RVS anywhere with internet without their IT team needing to open their internal license server to the world. This provided our customers with extra licenses for free as a stop-gap solution while our customers adjusted their IT systems to provide a longer-term solution.

The Rapita difference

Providing highly flexible licensing strategies is not industry-standard, and weâve heard from customers of other tools who are frustrated with their software licensing policies and support. For example, having to re-route to headquarters' servers to access licenses, buy extra licenses for use in different geographical locations, or deal with other restrictions that increase overall tool costs and make license systems more complex and harder to manage.

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="Yes, you can create and manage groups of users for your floating RVSÂ licenses. You can restrict each group to only serve licenses to specific hostnames or IP addresses. This allows you to reserve licenses for specific groups or specific purposes such as supporting the use of RVSÂ on a continuous integration server.

Any licenses that you donât reserve will remain available as floating licenses that can be shared among different users and geographic locations.

Separation of functional and time interferences concerns for efficient AMC 20-193 complianceÂ  Day 1 17:00-18:00Â  Lauraguais RoomÂ  D. Chabrol, J. Guyomarc'H, F. Siron, G. Phavorin, S. Thompson, E. Jenn &amp; F. ThurieauSafety-critical real-time systems must comply with stringent certification requirements, including temporal ones. Failure to comply with those temporal requirements may contribute to the system failure. Therefore, timing considerations, such as response times, are of the foremost importance for such systems.As the use of multi-/many-core hardware platforms is becoming inevitable in the avionics industry, due to the increasing computing performance required by modern embedded systems, integration activities are getting more and more complex. Increasing concurrency and parallelism exacerbates integration issues and introduces new challenging problems.Â To answer those challenges, certification authorities have issued guidelines, referenced as A(M)C 20-193, describing some objectives to fulfill for multi-/many-core integration. The present paper describes how a time-aware approach, based on the Synchronous Logical Execution Time paradigm (sLET), makes the design and integration of A(M)C 20-193 compliant safety-critical multi-/many-core systems easier by separating functional and time interferences concerns.The paper was produced by authors:Damien Chabrol - ASTERIOS Technologies, FranceJean Guyomarc'H - ASTERIOS Technologies, FranceFabien Siron - ASTERIOS Technologies, FranceGuillaume Phavorin - ASTERIOS Technologies, FranceSam Thompson - Rapita Systems Ltd, United KingdomEric Jenn - IRT Saint ExupÃ©ry, FranceFranÃ§ois Thurieau - Safran Electronics &amp; Defense, FranceMore information about the program is available at on ERTS' website.Â  " href="/events/erts-congress-2024" target="_blank">

A(M)C 20-193 vs. CAST-32A: What the change means for your DO-178C Multicore project
  </a>

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="
AMC 20-193, EASAâs official guidance document for certification of multicore software and hardware, was released on 21st January 2022.



Until the release of AMC 20-193, certification applicants for multicore software and hardware for ED-12C/DO-178C or ED-80/DO-254 projects followed CAST-32A guidance. For applicants certifying under EASA, AMC 20-193 has now superseded CAST-32A. [Edit] The FAA released its AC 20-193 guidance some two years after the release of AMC 20-193, on 8th January 2024, and the guidance is aligned with AMC 20-193 from a technical and certification perspective. As such, all of the insights in this blog that apply to AMC 20-193 also apply to AC 20-193.











Weâve spent some time reviewing the new guidance in order to highlight the differences between AMC 20-193 and CAST-32A. Here are the differences we found:



Dynamic allocation of software execution â CAST-32A discouraged the use of dynamic allocation mechanisms for software execution (such as task migration) in ED-12C/DO-178C projects. AMC 20-193 states that âjustification for using dynamic allocation features within the scope of this AMC may rely on robust and proven limitations that lead to deterministic behaviorâ. Activities relating to the appropriate use and verification of dynamic allocation of software execution remains outside the scope of the AMC.Simultaneous multithreading â guidance was given for certification of systems using simultaneous multithreading in CAST-32A. AMC 20-193 specifically states that this is not a multicore issue and offers no guidance for it. Youâll almost certainly still need to take any simultaneous multithreading into account in your ED-12C/DO-178C developments, but this isnât covered by AMC 20-193.Exemptions â CAST-32A specified some exemptions as to situations in which a multicore ED-12C/DO-178C would not need to meet CAST-32A objectives. AMC 20-193 adds a new exemption for systems where cores are acting as co-processors under the control of another core, such as GPUs whose execution is under the control of a CPU.Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) â AMC 20-193 includes a definition of IMA, which states that in the context of the AMC, an IMA platform meets the robust resource and time partitioning criteria listed in the AMC.Other definitions and clarifications â AMC 20-193 clarifies a number of other things that were mentioned in CAST-32A, for example clarifying that a multicore platform includes platform software such as an RTOS or hypervisor, and providing extra definitions for what constitutes a software or hardware component.Mitigation of changes to critical configuration settings â CAST-32Aâs MCP_Resource_Usage_2  objective provided guidance on the need to mitigate against inadvertent changes to critical platform configuration settings for ED-12C/DO-178C certification of multicore systems. AMC 20-193 does not include such guidance, stating that this objective is already provided in AMC 20-152A (Objective COTS-8 ).Use of simulators â AMC 20-193 discourages the use of simulators in its MCP_Software_1  objective.Data Coupling Control Coupling â AMC 20-193 clarifies that tasks on one component may execute on other cores, so tasks on the same component may interfere with each other.



Are you working on a multicore ED-12C or DO-178C project, expecting to start one soon, or wanting to evaluate the use of multicore systems for ED-12C/DO-178C? If so, MACH178 can help you evaluate multicore technologies and provide the evidence you need for certification.

            RapiTime supports the investigation of multicore interference effects and plays a critical role in the MACH178Â solution and Multicore Timing Solution.
        
        
            Within these solutions, RapiTime supports multicore timing analysis by allowing the collection of execution time results, the collection of values from hardware event monitors (HEMs), the analysis of results, and the export of results to produce compliance evidence.
        
        
            Multicore timing analysis is further supported by the following RVS and supplementary tools:
        
        
            
                RapiDaemonsÂ support interference analysis by applying configurable degrees of contention on hardware resources while tests run
            
            
                RapiTestÂ supports the creation ofÂ multicore tests,Â which apply interference using RapiDaemonsÂ and collect values from HEMs,Â and runs these on the target hardware
            
            
                RapiTaskÂ can be used to visualize the scheduling behavior of multicore applications and identify rare events such as priority inversions

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="Partitioning is well understood for single core systems. Two types of partitioning exist: space (or resource) partitioning, where partitioned components are isolated by operating on different hardware devices or different regions in a single device, and time partitioning, where partitioned components are isolated by operating in non-overlapping time periods (time slices). Both types of isolation are well understood for single core systems, and are implemented in many real-time operating systems used in the aerospace domain through the use of scheduling architectures such as ARINC 653.

The most rigorous separation is termed robust partitioning. This is defined for single core systems in the ARINC 653 standard, where it refers to complete isolation of separated components, i.e. the execution of one component can have no effect on the other. To put this another way, the execution time of each thread is completely free from interference by the other threads (Figure 1).


  
    
      Figure 1. When threads in a single core system are scheduled according to e.g. ARINC 653 schedules, threads can be temporally isolated and free from interference
      
    
  

Most of the technology for partitioning of single core systems also applies to multicore systems. Multicore systems are more complex, however â for these systems, interference can exist between software hosted on different cores but running at the same time. Various interference channels can exist in such a system, such as for shared resources, and interference can increase software execution times and cause software to become non-deterministic (Figure 2). While the use of scheduling architectures such as ARINC 653 is enough to isolate partitioned software components in single core systems and ensure that the software is free from interference, this is not the case for multicore systems, where interference can be present even between (space) partitioned threads.


  
    
      Figure 2. In a multicore system, interference can result from software running on different cores sharing use of common resources
      
    
  

For multicore systems, robust partitioning according to its understood single core definition (isolation and freedom from interference) cannot be guaranteed by using a scheduling architecture alone. Because of this, we could infer that robust partitioning is not possible in multicore systems. CAST-32A, however, provides guidance on robust partitioning1, stating that robust space partitioning is comparable for single core and multicore systems, and providing a definition of robust time partitioning for multicore systems, stating that â[robust time partitioning is] achieved when, as a result of mitigating the time interference between partitions hosted on different cores, no software partition consumes more than its allocation of execution time on the core(s) on which it executes, irrespective of whether partitions are executing on none of the other active cores or on all of the other active cores.â. A sensible interpretation of this definition is that robust time partitioning is achieved when each software partition is guaranteed to meet its critical timing deadlines even when interference is present. To meet CAST-32A objectives and provide evidence that the software is robustly partitioned, the platform and hosted software must be tested by the analysis of software execution times when multicore interference is present. While various strategies may be used to mitigate against the actual interference present, this analysis is still necessary to demonstrate robust partitioning.

A major benefit of demonstrating robust partitioning is that it enables the use of software with different criticality levels to be executed on the same computing platform, provided that they are segregated into different partitions. Otherwise, even software that could nominally be certified to a lower Design Assurance Level would be forced to certify to the highest assurance level of any software on the system. Demonstrating robust partitioning also enables incremental assurance, allowing each supplier to test their software partitions independently of other suppliers. In this case, certification artifacts can be generated incrementally and aggregated by the system integrator. To be able to demonstrate robust partitioning to multicore systems and achieve these benefits, unique techniques are needed to support the analysis of software execution times when multicore interference is present, such as MACH178.

SOI #4 - Certification Review





The final stage of involvement is the Certification review (SOI#4). This review typically follows the Quality Assurance Conformity Review and is focused on ensuring all compliance evidence is complete and correct. A fundamental part of each of the SOI reviews is an examination of the configuration management processes and baselines and the evidence that quality assurance* has been active during the design assurance process.

*Software Quality Assurance (SQA), one of the Integral processes of DO-178C, provides the evidence showing that a project complies with processes, standards and guidance throughout the development life cycle. Broadly, there are six areas of software quality focus throughout a project. 





At the beginning of a project:


	1. Checking that the PSAC and the associated plans and standards align with the objectives of DO-178C.
	2. Creating the Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP).
	3. Checking that software life cycle processes comply with approved plans and standards.
	4. Establishing supplier oversight.


During the project:


	5. Checking that software activity follows the software life cycle processes â in particular, checking that transition criteria between life cycle processes are satisfied.


At the end of the project:


	6. Conducting the conformity review of the software product.


SOI #4 looks back at each of the previous SOI reviews and ensures that all observations and findings have been resolved to the satisfaction of the certification authority. The review also ensures that the final design and deliverable documentation are complete and correct.







SOI #4 is a detailed examination of all the development and verification artifacts to ensure that a complete and consistent design baseline is documented. This may involve the certification authority asking to see you building and loading a specific baseline, running tests against that baseline to produce the same results you reported previously, and performing desk reviews of documents and face to face audits. During the SOI, you may be asked to re-review any artifact or evidence produced during the whole life cycle of your project, so itâs important to make sure that all of your life cycle data is kept up to date with the current baseline through all stages of development and verification.

SOI #3 - Verification Review





A number of verification activities are required by DO-178C. Some of these activities involve verification of the developed software, while some involve verification that your DO-178C verification process was correctly followed. Many verification activities can be performed either manually or by using automated tools to help run the analysis. When automated tools are used to achieve a DO-178C objective without their output being verified, those tools must be qualified for use following the DO-330* guidelines.

*DO-330: Software Tool Qualification Considerations supplement to DO-178C gives specific guidance on situations in which you need to qualify any verification tools you use in order to demonstrate that they work as intended. Because of this, it makes sense to begin your verification activities early and not leave verification activities until late in your project life cycle. 





Certification authorities will expect that you document your verification results in a series of documents, some of which you will submit in your final compliance demonstration data. The documents that are typically expected include:


	Software Accomplishment Summary (SAS), which gives the overall compliance position, states the timing and memory margins, and summarizes any agreed process deviations and open or deferred problem reports. This document is always submitted.
	Software Verification Results (SVR), which lists the verification activities conducted (reviews, analyses and tests), gives the results, summarizes problem reports for any failed verification activities, and typically also includes traceability and coverage data. This document is sometimes submitted and sometimes just made available for external review.
	Software Verification Cases and Procedures (SVCP), which gives the design of each review, analysis and test to conduct. This includes details such as test environment setup, schedules, staffing, auditing, and efficiency concerns. It isnât expected that this document is submitted.


Similarly to SOI #2(development review), SOI #3 should be conducted with the certification authority when there are examples of each of the verification artifacts available for review. SOI #3 focuses not only on test cases and test procedures, but also on test results and coverage analyses.







You do not need to complete the verification of your software before SOI #3, but this milestone is usually reached after:


	Around half or more of the total expected test cases and procedures have been developed and reviewed.
	The approach youâll take for verifying your verification process (e.g., structural coverage, data coupling and control coupling coverage) is demonstrable (ideally with at least sample data being available).
	The approach youâll take for verifying non-functional properties of your software, including resource usage, is demonstrable (ideally with at least sample data being available).


The review will examine traceability information and also examine how changes have been managed throughout the life cycle of your project.

    SOI #2 - Development Review
    
  


  
    After SOI #1, the next step is to develop your product. The first step in Development is to define the high-level requirements of your code. Later in Development, you will define low-level requirements. Developing high-level requirements involves refining the context of system requirements allocated to software and defining any software-specific requirements that do not map to system requirements as derived requirements. While defining both high and low-level requirements, you should ensure that you follow the processes you agreed to follow in your PSAC â your certification authority is likely to check that you have done so during future SOIs.
    
  
  
  


  
    When your requirements are available, the next step is to design the architecture of your software and define its low-level requirements in order to define a system that can meet the high-level requirements you have identified. Design in DO-178C is the combination of architecture and low-level requirements. You will need to follow the design standards you said you would follow in your PSAC and provide evidence that you have done this.
    
    When your requirements and design are ready, the next step will be to implement your product in code. This is comparatively only a small part of the overall compliance process, usually taking 5% or less of overall effort. The decisions you make on how to implement your product can have major effects on your verification later on. These can make your verification much easier or much more difficult, and as a result cause your project to either run smoothly or incur delays. As verification takes much more effort than implementation, itâs worth considering the effects your decisions will have and making decisions that will reduce your verification effort.
    
  


  
    Here are a few things you may want to consider:
    
    
      Choice of programming language(s)
      Choice of coding standard(s)
      Choice of hardware platform and operating system
      Choice of compiler and compiler options
      Use of emerging technologies (GPUs, multi-core processors etc.)
    
  
  
  


  
    Before you have finished your Development, but when you have examples of each of your development artifacts (typically 60%-80% of your total expected artifacts), you should conduct SOI #2 with your certification authority. SOI #2 focuses on the development process and artifacts, but the review also considers verification processes that should be running concurrently with Development â specifically, the review activities being implemented. SOI #2 may also look forward to the verification phase to see if there are any examples where verification activities have provided feedback to development activities. This may include, for example, test case development or test environment development providing feedback to your requirements and design processes to ensure that test activities can completely verify the functionality expressed in your requirements and design.

SOI #1 - Planning Review

Following on from our first blog (Introduction to DO-178C), we provide you an insight into the first stage of involvement review for the DO-178C process.







Planning is a crucial part of DO-178C compliance, and it sets the scene for your projectâs activities and the efficiency of those activities in later stages. You can save effort in your DO-178C planning by using a set of template planning documents as a starting point. The development of a set of plans covering all components of the Design Assurance process is a cornerstone of DO-178C.





As part of this activity, the following plans must be developed:


	Plan for Software Aspects of Certification (PSAC): a description of the software you plan to develop, the hardware environment it will be used in, the design assurance processes you will follow, and how you will demonstrate compliance, including how you will verify your implemented code and any commercial tools you will use in your verification. This acts as the parent planning document.
	Software Development Plan (SDP): a description of the software development processes and the software life cycle that is used to satisfy DO-178C objectives.
	Software Verification Plan (SVP): a description of the verification processes (Reviews, Analyses and Tests) used to satisfy DO-178C objectives.
	Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP): a description of the methods and environment that will be used to configure all the design data and compliance evidence needed to achieve DO-178C certification.
	Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP): a description of the methods and associated records that will be used to ensure that DO-178C quality assurance objectives are satisfied.






For higher DAL levels, as well as producing the above planning documents, you will also need to establish and document the standards you will use for Requirements, Design, and Code, documenting the methods, rules, and tools you will use to ensure complete and consistent generation of these items in a way that will meet DO-178C and project objectives. It pays to put effort into writing your standards â having well thought out standards reduces the chance of incurring rework costs later due to issues that could be addressed through having better standards, such as producing unverifiable requirements.







When your plans are complete and have been reviewed and signed off internally, it will be time to take the first step in the compliance process by having the SOI#1 review with your certification authority. The SOI#1 review is typically a âdeskâ review performed by the authority, who will thoroughly review all plans and standards to ensure that all applicable objectives of DO-178C and any relevant supplements will be satisfied if the development proceeds as documented in your plans. This review will result in either a report documenting any observations or findings that must be resolved, or acceptance that your plans and standards are compliant. When your plans have been accepted, the next step is to follow them!

Introduction to DO-178C

When a system is made up of mechanical and electronic components, for which the component failure rate is known, the probability of failure for the system can be calculated and achievement of the safety target can be demonstrated. For software, complex systems or electronic hardware, system failures can be caused by design errors (sometimes known as systematic failures) as well as component failures, but there is no agreed way of calculating the failure rate of these design errors. In the aerospace domain, the agreed approach for dealing with design errors is to implement design assurance processes that have specific activities to identify and eliminate design errors throughout the software development life cycle.





DO-178 was originally developed in the late 1970s and released in 1982 to define a prescriptive set of design assurance processes for airborne software that focused on documentation and testing. In the 1980s, DO-178 was updated to DO-178A, which suggested different levels of activities dependent on the criticality of the software, but the process remained prescriptive. Released in 1992, DO-178B was a total re-write of DO-178 to move away from the prescriptive process approach and define a set of activities and associated objectives that a design assurance process must meet.







This update allowed flexibility in the development approaches that could be followed, but also specified fundamental attributes that a design assurance process must have, which were derived from airworthiness regulations. These included, for example, demonstrating implementation of intended function, identifying potential unintended function, and verification of an integrated build running on the target hardware.





Advances in software engineering technologies and methodologies since the release of DO-178B made consistent application of the DO-178 objectives difficult. In 2012, DO- 178C was released, which clarified details and removed inconsistencies from DO-178B, and which also includes supplements that provide guidance for design assurance when specific technologies are used, supporting a more consistent approach to compliance for software developers using these technologies. DO-178C guidance also clarified some details within DO-178B so that the original intent could be better understood and more accurately met by developers.

DO-178B introduced (and DO-178C continued to use) the fundamental concept of the Design Assurance Level (DAL), which defines the amount of rigor that should be applied by the design assurance process based on the contribution to Aircraft Safety. The higher the DAL, the more activities and objectives that must be performed and met as part of the Design Assurance process because of the more severe consequences to the aircraft should the software fail or malfunction.





The basic structure of a Design Assurance process consists of three components:


	Planning
	Development
	Integral processes (Verification, Configuration Managements, Quality Assurance and Certification Liaison)




The typical process for the certification authority to determine compliance is based on four âStage Of Involvementâ (SOI) reviews. These reviews are:


	SOI#1 or Planning Review
	SOI#2 or Development Review
	SOI#3 or Verification Review
	SOI#4 or Certification review








Each of these reviews focuses on an aspect of the process and evaluates the evidence that demonstrates compliance incrementally throughout the development life cycle. We discuss each of the SOIs in more detail in the links above. Generally, certification authorities require that each SOI is passed before a project can proceed to the next SOI. SOIs thus mark key milestones in a DO-178C project.

In this webinar, multicore certification expert Dr. Christos Evripidou, outlines new certification activities and resources that can be flexibly integrated into your existing DO-178C workflow to satisfy the full scope of multicore certification objectives.

CAST-32A, (now known asÂ A(M)C 20-193), sets out a number of new objectives that need to be met in addition to existing DO-178C guidance. To comply with this new guidance, it is necessary to adapt your existing DO-178C verification workflow to demonstrate that these additional objectives are met.

Presentaion details: Rapita have developed a novel workflow for multicore DO-178C verification that satisfies multicore-specific objectives. This new workflow includes both adaptations of existing DO-178C materials (for example checklists and reports), new materials including the âPlan for Multicore Aspects of Certificationâ, or âPMACâ and processes for complying with the verification objectives of CAST-32A.

            Rapita Systems, a leading tools and services provider to the aerospace (DO-178C) and defense industries, is proud to have been selected by NASA to support software verification for the Lunar Gateway project.
        
        
            The Lunar Gateway, often simply referred to as âGatewayâ, is part of NASAâs Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the surface of the moon. The Gateway will be a small space station in lunar orbit acting as a communications hub, science lab, short-term astronaut habitation module and holding area for rovers and other robots.
        
    


    
        
            
            
                Lunar Gateway (Space Station in Lunar Orbit)
            
        
    
    
        
            Rapita is providing both RapiTest and RapiCover for the Gateway project to make software verification activities as streamlined and efficient as possible.
        
        
            RapiTest, the unit test management tool in the Rapita Verification Suite, will enable NASA engineers to author, manage and execute software tests both on-host and on-target. RapiTest is used by many of the largest aerospace companies in the world to manage their testing and is designed to flexibly integrate into any software development workflow.
        
    


    
        
            Powerful features like easy-to-use test formats and flexible stubbing improve the efficiency of time-intensive software testing activities. RapiTest integrates with continuous integration and requirements management software, allowing engineers to integrate RapiTest into their existing workflow with minimal disruption to established practices.
        
    


    
        
            RapiCover, the code coverage tool in the Rapita Verification Suite, will help NASA engineers reduce the effort needed to collect and analyze code coverage metrics for Gateway software.
        
        
            RapiCover features some of the lowest instrumentation overheads available on the market, reducing the number of builds needed for coverage collection, and supports complex code with up to 1,000 conditions per decision. RapiCoverâs efficient âmerge and markâ workflow makes handling large, complex codebases more efficient than ever.
        
    
    
        
            
            
                RapiCover
            
        
    


    
        
            NASAâs adoption of the Rapita Verification Suite builds on Rapitaâs stellar reputation within the space industry, with RVS having been deployed on high-profile satellites including the European Space Agencyâs Solar Orbiter and Electra satellite programs.

When we release a new version of RVS, we reduce the migration steps needed to update existing projects to the new version as much as possible, both by minimizing changes to important parts of the workflowÂ and by having RVS automatically migrate as many settings as possible through scripts.Â 

From time to time, however, some migration actions may need manual attention. When you upgrade your project to run it with a new version of RVS, any such migration actions are automatically highlighted for you, with tips and instructions for how to address them.

As test authoring and review take a large amount of overall effort in requirements-based testing projects, the efficiency of these activities is important. Weâve been thinking about how we can improve the efficiency of these activities in RapiTest recently, and thatâs why weâve been developing a new testing format that lets you write your tests directly in the RVS Project Manager.



Edit: The first official version of the RapiTest Editor (shown in the video above) was releasedÂ in RVS 3.16, after the publication of this blog.




RapiTest currently supports two nativeÂ testing formats: an easy-to-read spreadsheet-based testing format, and a scripting format (Figure 1). The former makes the test-writing experience easier and more accessible for people who are unfamiliar with scripting languages, while the latter supports writing more complex tests with features such as conditional logic. As well as these native formats, RapiTest supports a variety of third-party formats.





Figure 1. RapiTest test authoring formats. Spreadsheet format (left), Scripting format (right).





For the last few months, weâve been developing and testing a third native testing option that lets you write tests directly in the RVS Project Manager, known as the RapiTest Editor. As the new test editor is intimately coupled with our UI, this has enabled us to develop the format with a range of benefits that can reduce test authoring and reviewing effort (Figure 2):

	Automatic test framework generation based on selection of a unit under test.
	Both syntactic and semantic error highlighting â while our scripting format offers syntactic error highlighting, we can go one step further with this format and highlight semantic errors as well.
	Viewing expected and achieved results alongside your tests â this makes it easier to fix failing tests.
	Context-sensitive help â the new format offers a more guided user experience, making it clearer what the next step is and easier to access documentation.
	Consistent formatting for readability â test layout and formatting is handled automatically, making all tests consistent.






Figure 2. The RapiTest Editor reduces test authoring and review effort. Test authoring is in a table-based format, similar to the spreadsheet format (left), In-built tutorials aond context-specific help deliver a guided user experience (right).





The RapiTest Editor is still under development, and we plan to release the first official version in RVS 3.16. If youâre an existing RapiTest customer and want to test it before then, contact us and weâll share a wavefront version so you can try it out.
Update on the latest developments in flexible test authoring in RapiTest can be found below:
RapiTestÂ now gives you flexibility in writing your tests by providing three testing options: theÂ RapiTest EditorÂ format, which is integrated into the RapiTestÂ user-interface, aÂ spreadsheet formatÂ and aÂ scripting language.

RVS lets you redact source code from your RVS project while still supporting subsequent verification. This supports use cases where there may be a requirement to not share source code, such as if you plan to outsource verification activities to a third-party company to which you don't want to reveal your source code.

This works as follows:


	RVS lets you redact the source code from your RVS project, removing it so that only file and function names in the source code can be viewed in the RVS project.
	Verification activities can then be performed on the redacted project.
	When verification activities have been achieved, the resulting RVS report can be merged with a report that includes the source code to restore it.

  RVS includes a custom exporter that lets you generate custom reports for results from your multicore timing analysis. Using this exporter, you can pull results from any of your collected performance metrics and automatically report pass/fail status based on your success criteria.
  
  To generate custom multicore reports, you generate an input template file in a Markdown format. This can include free form text, metadata such as traceability information, and references to the results you want to include by using an API to your RVS report. RVS includes documentation and examples to help you get started writing your templates.
  
  After generating your input template, you can export your results from within the RVS Project Manager using an inbuilt document converter, which lets you generate outputs in Markdown, Word, HTML and PDF formats.
  
  You can configure the formatting for your output files using output templates. You can use one of our pre-defined output templates directly, use them to help you get started writing a template, or create custom templates for you and your team.

            Multicore processors are being rapidly adopted by the avionics industry due to their improved Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) characteristics combined with the diminishing availability of single-core processors. Whilst more powerful, multicore-based systems present a set of additional challenges when it comes to verifying and certifying avionics systems. NXP, Curtiss-Wright and Rapita Systems are leading the industry approach to solving the verification and certification challenges multicore processors present.
        
        
            In this live webinar event, experts from the companies will describe where their solutions fit into the multicore avionics ecosystem and how they work together to enable the safe use of multicore processors in safety-critical systems (as per AC 20-193, AMC 20-193 and CAST-32A). The presenters will also describe how you can participate in industry working groups like the Multi-Core For Avionics (MCFA) group, which grants industry stakeholders access to normally-restricted multicore hardware IP.
        
        
            This technical event will also feature a new, live demonstration of the latest hardware and software technologies designed to solve multicore challenges.

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="FACE Architecture

The US Department of Defense continues to push for the use of open architecture solutions as a means to get better avionics hardware into the field more quickly and at a lower cost. One source of such solutions is the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACEâ¢) consortium, founded in 2010 to develop an open architecture technical standard as well as business models for implementing FACE standards in systems. The consortium is managed by the Open Group, and has members from government, education, and industry sectors. Â Member organizations must be incorporated in the US and individual members must be US citizens, though the annual FACE Technical Interchange Meeting typically includes an exhibition that is open to all. There are currently 91 organizations and over 1,000 individuals with a membership. The consortium sponsors four general working sessions a year, called the FACE F2F. Â Volunteer members do the detailed work of the consortium through technical and business working groups overseen by a steering committee and advisory board.

One of the most significant products of the FACE consortium has been the development of a technical standard, which is currently at revision 3.0 Â According to theÂ FACE website, âThe FACE Technical Standard is the open avionics standard for making military computing operations more robust, interoperable, portable and secure. The standard enables developers to create and deploy a wide catalog of applications for use across the entire spectrum of military aviation systems through a common operating environment.â

    MACH178 creates an environment where multicore timing behavior can be analyzed through an automated tool framework. Within this environment, input characterization tests for multicore timing behavior (which use RapiDaemonsÂ to create contention on specific hardware resources) are converted into test harnesses, and these are run on the target to produce results that can be analyzed.
    
    
    
    This automated environment significantly reduces the effort needed to run tests. Typically, we use this framework to analyze multicore timing behavior ourselves, but if you want to do the analysis yourself, we can help you by offering in-depth training.

Different multicore hardware and RTOS environments may have vastly different effects on the timing behavior of applications.

MACH178 helps you evaluate different environments to identify the best one for you, so you can mitigate the impact of interference channels in the system and ensure that your platform has whatâs needed to support your verification all the way through to certification.

Using a combination of our expert services, RapiDaemons, (small applications designed to generate configurable load on specific shared resources), and RVS tools to automate the collection of timing evidence on-target, MACH178 helps you identify sources of multicore interference and quantify their effects on your application.

Following our robust process, we identify the potential interference channels your multicore platform, produce on-target tests that analyze the impact of interference on software timing behavior, and run these on your system through an automated framework. Our expert team then analyzes the results to produce the evidence you need to demonstrate that your code will meet its timing deadlines.

  RVS includes a custom exporter that lets you generate custom reports for results from your multicore timing analysis. Using this exporter, you can pull results from any of your collected performance metrics and automatically report pass/fail status based on your success criteria.
  
  To generate custom multicore reports, you generate an input template file in a Markdown format. This can include free form text, metadata such as traceability information, and references to the results you want to include by using an API to your RVS report. RVS includes documentation and examples to help you get started writing your templates.
  
  After generating your input template, you can export your results from within the RVS Project Manager using an inbuilt document converter, which lets you generate outputs in Markdown, Word, HTML and PDF formats.
  
  You can configure the formatting for your output files using output templates. You can use one of our pre-defined output templates directly, use them to help you get started writing a template, or create custom templates for you and your team.

Modern embedded software is trusted to directly control critical functions of complex machines like cars and airplanes. This trust can only be established through the use of high-quality development practices and extensive testing.

Guidance such as DO-178C and ISO 26262 exists to ensure that clear, implementable steps can be taken by embedded system developers to adhere to best practices while also prescribing specific testing requirements dependent on the criticality of the system under test.

A range of commercial embedded testing tools designed to make rigorous embedded software testing more efficient and cost-effective are available. This white paper discusses 5 key factors to consider when choosing an embedded testing tool.

    We develop custom tools and utilities to meet specific verification use cases. Some examples of the custom tools we have developed include:
    
    
      A tool that helps users automatically check constraints in software execution such as the time between calls to different functions or the order in which functions execute.
      A tool that helps users perform stack analysis by collecting stack usage data, such as worst-case stack usage for functions and sub-functions and the depth of functions in the high-water mark call stack.
      A tool that helps detect errors in hardware by automatically generating a version of software where computations are made using different numbers to the original software â comparison of results from running both software versions can identify faults in the hardware.
      A tool that helps users compare the differences between two executable files and assesses those differences in terms of their likely effects on software execution.
      A processor simulator to support structural coverage analysis and worst-case execution time analysis.
      Custom converters for test formats that allow tests written in other test formats to be run with RapiTest.

We verify the behavior of compilers to support efficient software V&amp;V and compliance, e.g. to show that no code untraceable to source code is generated by compiler optimizations as per DO-178C guidelines. We offer compiler verification services including the following:


	Investigating compiler behavior when different compiler options are used
	Defining a scope of compiler options that can be used to produce compliant software
	Investigating the behavior of different code constructs given a specific set of compiler options
	Generating compliance evidence to show that no additional untraceable code has been generated


For more information, see our Compiler verification case study.

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="We design and build automated test environments for software V&amp;V, which either you or our engineers can use.

We set up our test environments to work alongside your development environment, taking advantage of any tools you use for source configuration management, requirements traceability and continuous integration. Our test environments use the Rapita Verification Suite (RVS) along with other supporting hardware and software to help support V&amp;V activities including the following:


	Requirements-based testing functional testing
	
		Normal range and robustness testing
	
	
	Regression testing
	Structural coverage analysis
	Worst-case execution time analysis and timing optimization
	Understanding and troubleshooting system scheduling behavior
	Checking compliance to coding standards


We design and build custom test benches to exercise your electronics and perform hardware in the loop testing and can set up and operate labs to perform stability testing for your electronics.

Our test environments support projects working towards DO-178C certification also supporting multicore systems, verifying them in line with DO-178C (CAST-32A/A(M)C 20-193) objectives. Where test environments are to be used by your engineers, we provide a detailed report on how to use the environment and can deliverÂ trainingÂ to ensure that your engineers make the best use of the environment.

          RTCA DO-178C / EUROCAE ED-12C: Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification is the primary document by which certification authorities such as the FAA and EASA approveÂ civil software-based aerospace systems. Recently, it has become the de facto approach for demonstrating airworthiness in military avionics systems worldwide.

        Introduction to DO-178C
        DO-178 was originally developed in the late 1970s to define a prescriptive set of design assurance processes for airborne software that focused on documentation and testing. In the 1980s, DO-178 was updated to DO-178A, which suggested different levels of activities dependent on the criticality of the software, but the process remained prescriptive.
        Released in 1992, DO-178B was a total re-write of DO-178 to move away from the prescriptive process approach and define a set of activities and associated objectives that a design assurance process must meet. This update allowed flexibility in the development approaches that could be followed, but also specified fundamental attributes that a design assurance process must have, which were derived from the airworthiness regulations.
      
      
        
          
            
          
        
      
    
    
      
        Many advances in software engineering technologies and methodologies since the release of DO-178B made consistent application of the DO-178 objectives difficult. In 2012, DO-178C/ED-12C was released, which clarified details and removed inconsistencies from DO-178B, and which also includes supplements that provide guidance for design assurance when specific technologies are used, supporting a more consistent approach to compliance for software developers using these technologies. DO-178C guidance also clarified some details within DO-178B so that the original intent could be better understood and more accurately met by developers.

          Design Assurance Levels
          DO-178B introduced (and DO-178C continued to use) the fundamental concept of the Design Assurance Level (DAL), which defines the amount of rigor that should be applied by the design assurance process based on the contribution to Aircraft Safety. The higher the DAL, the more activities and objectives that must be performed and met as part of the Design Assurance process because of the more severe consequences to the aircraft should the software fail or malfunction.
          
            
              The five DALs, which are summarized in the table below, determine the amount of rigor required in the development and testing of a specific piece of airborne software.

            Planning
            DO-178C planning is the first DO-178C process that should occur and follows the basic design assurance principle that you say what you are going to do before you do it so you can ensure that what you plan to do will meet the required DO-178C objectives and provide evidence to demonstrate this.
            Development of a set of plans covering all components of the Design Assurance process is a cornerstone of DO-178C. As part of this activity, the following plans must be developed:
            
              Plan for Software Aspects of Certification (PSAC): a description of the software you plan to develop, the hardware environment it will be used in, the design assurance processes you will follow, and how you will demonstrate compliance, including how you will verify your implemented code and any commercial tools you will use in your verification.
              Software Development Plan (SDP): a description of the software development processes and the software life cycle that is used to satisfy DO-178C objectives.
              Software Verification Plan (SVP): a description of the verification processes (Reviews, Analyses and Tests) used to satisfy DO-178C objectives.
              Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP): a description of the methods and environment that will be used to configure all of the design data and compliance evidence needed to achieve DO-178C certification.
              Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP): a description of the methods and associated records that will be used to ensure that DO-178C quality assurance objectives are satisfied.
            
          
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          
            Development
            Development covers all of the activities that involve design and production of DO-178C software that meets system requirements of the project. This includes definition of high and low-level software requirements, software architecture definition and implementation of the software.
            Requirements should be developed in order to meet system requirements of the component hosting the software. These system requirements may be decomposed into hardware requirements (DO-254) as well as software components. Requirements should be verifiable as they will need to be verified in order to generate compliance evidence.
            The software architecture must be designed before the software is implemented. It is worth considering how the software architecture will affect verification efficiency as verification comprises a large proportion of the cost of a DO-178C project. Particularly, it is worth considering how your architecture will affect the efficiency of data coupling and control coupling analysis of your implemented software.
            Engineers new to DO-178C may be surprised at how small a proportion of overall effort Implementation takes in a DO-178C project, particularly at high DALs e.g. DAL A. As verification is much morwe effort intensive than implementation, it is worth considering how implementation decisions such as choice of language and language constructs used, choice of hardware platform and choice of compiler and compiler options will affect verification efficiency.
          
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          
            Integral processes
            DO-178C includes 4 Integral processes, which are followed throughout a DO-178C project. These are Verification, Configuration Management, Quality Assurance and Certification Liaison. Integral processes should be planned during DO-178C planning. Following the processes should generate evidence that can be provided to certification authorities to demonstrate that you have followed the processes you planned to (and agreed with the certification authority). 
            
              Verification covers activities needed to demonstrate that DO-178C software functions as intended. You will plan a Verification strategy in your Software Verification Plan and follow this after. Some Verification activities should be achieved by testing, while some are achieved by reviews. Software tools are often used to reduce the effort needed to verify DO-178C software.
            
            
              Configuration Management covers the processes by which you will control and track versioning of items developed during DO-178C projects, including software and documents such as reviews. Your Configuration Management process must generate a record of every version of every item, and these should be accessible throughout the project.
            
            
              Quality Assurance covers activities that demonstrate that you are following the plans and standards that you have said you will follow throughout a DO-178C project. This includes change control, problem reporting and conducting a conformance review to ensure that your DO-178C software and related documents are ready to share with your certification authority in the final Stage of Involvement (SOI).
            
            
              Certification Liaison covers activities in which you will interact directly with your certification authority, including the processes you will follow to prepare for and conduct the DO-178C SOIs with them.
            
          
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
    
      
        The typical process for the certification authority to determine compliance is based on four âStage Of Involvementâ (SOI) reviews/audits. These reviews are:
        
          
            SOI#1 or Planning Review
          
          
            SOI#2 or Development Review
          
          
            SOI#3 or Verification Review
          
          
            SOI#4 or Certification review
          
        
        Each of these reviews focuses on an aspect of the process and evaluates the evidence that demonstrates compliance incrementally throughout the development life cycle.

        Tool qualification
      
    
    
      
        As per DO-178C, you need to qualify any software tool you use that replaces or mitigates any DO-178C process and for which the output is not manually verified. The qualification process ensures that such software tools can be relied upon to produce appropriate and repeatable results.
        DO-178C itself describes when a tool must be qualified, but does not go into detail on how this should be done. The DO-330: Software Tool Qualification Considerations supplement to DO-178C expands on this guidance by defining corresponding objectives for the specification, development and verification of qualified tools.
      
      
        
          
        
      
    
    
      
        If you use any commercial verification tools to automate DO-178C verification processes and donât plan on manually reviewing output from the tools, they will need to be qualified at the appropriate tool qualification level. Many commercial verification tools have supporting qualification kits, which include evidence needed to demonstrate that the activities the tool developer must perform have been performed. All qualification kits should include all of the evidence needed from the tool developer. Some qualification kits may also include supporting material to help meet tool user objectives.

        The safety assessment processes used in all functional safety domains rely on demonstrating that the probability of system failure that could cause harm is below an acceptable threshold.
        When a system is made up of mechanical and electronic components, for which the component failure rate is known, the probability of failure for the system can be calculated and achievement of the safety target can be demonstrated. For software, complex systems or electronic hardware, system failures can be caused by design errors (sometimes known as systematic failures) as well as component failures, but there is no agreed way of calculating the failure rate of these design errors. In the aerospace domain, the agreed approach for dealing with design errors is to implement design assurance processes that have specific activities to identify and eliminate design errors throughout the software development life cycle.
        DO-178 was originally developed in the late 1970s to define a prescriptive set of design assurance processes for airborne software that focused on documentation and testing.
      
    
    
      
        Design Assurance Levels (DALs)
        DO-178B introduced (and DO-178C continued to use) the fundamental concept of the Design Assurance Level (DAL), which defines the amount of rigor that should be applied by the design assurance process based on the contribution to Aircraft Safety. The higher the DAL, the more activities and objectives that must be performed and met as part of the Design Assurance process because of the more severe consequences to the aircraft should the software fail or malfunction. Design Assurance Level A (DAL-A) is the highest level of design assurance that can be applied to airborne software and is applied when failure or malfunction of the software could contribute to a catastrophic failure of the aircraft. The activities and objectives that must be met through the Design Assurance process gradually decrease with each level alphabetically until DAL-E, which has no objectives as there is no consequence to aircraft safety should such software fail or malfunction.
        Objectives and activities
        The recommendations given in DO-178 fall into two types:
        
          Objectives, which are process requirements that should be met in order to demonstrate compliance to regulations
          Activities, which are tasks that provide the means of meeting objectives
        
        In total, DO-178C includes 71 objectives, 43 of which are related to verification. The number of these objectives that must be met for compliance reduces as the Design Assurance Level of the system reduces.
      
    
    
      
        Supplementary objectives and guidance
        DO-178C introduced three technology supplements to provide an interpretation of the DO-178C activities and objectives in the context of using specific technologies. The three technologies are Model Based Development and Verification (DO-331), Object Oriented Technology and related technologies (DO-332), and Formal Methods (DO-333). Each supplement describes the technology, defines the scope of its use within airborne software, lists additional or alternative activities and objectives that must be met when the technology is used, and includes specific FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) that clarify objectives and activities relating to the technology.
        A further supplement was introduced in DO-178C, Software Tool Qualification Considerations (DO-330), which gives guidance on the qualification of tools used in software development and verification processes. This guidance can be applied to any tools, not just those used for software development or verification, for example systems design or hardware development tools, and acts more like a stand-alone guidance document than the other supplements mentioned.
        Many other documents support DO-178C by providing additional clarification or explanations that can help developers to correctly interpret the guidance and implement appropriate design assurance processes. The Supporting Information (DO-248C) supplementary document includes FAQs relating to DO-178C, and the document is commonly referred to by the title Frequently Asked Questions. In addition to the FAQs in DO-248C, the document provides the rationale for the activities and objectives listed in DO-178C and includes discussion papers that provide clarification on specific topics related to software development and verification. A series of documents produced by the Certification Authorities Software Team (CAST) since the release of DO-178B provided information on specific topics of concern to certification authorities in order to harmonize approaches to compliance. These topics have had a greater scope than just Software concerns, and much of the content in CAST documents has been implemented in guidance updates such as DO-178C, or formed the basis of authority publications, such as A(M)C 20-193 to address the use of multicore processors in avionics and A(M)C 20-152A on the development of airborne electronics hardware. CAST has remained inactive since October 2016 and links to most previous CAST papers have been removed from the FAAâs website...........

            An academic paper featuring work from Rapita's CEO Dr. Guillem Bernat has been published in the IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing journal.
        
    


    
        
            This paper is now available to download directly from IEEE's website at the following link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8408556.
        
        
            The paper was co-authored by experts from Barcelona Supercomputing Center: Gabriel Fernandez, Jaume Abella and Francisco J. Cazorla.
        
        
            In this paper a new modeling approach for multicore systemsÂ is proposed, which is tailored for a specific processor in the space domain, that simplifies time budgeting in EDP by developing surrogate applications and an automatic framework to generate them.
        
        
            This research is related to the MACH178 solution offered by Rapita. Specifically, the Surrogate RapiDaemon tool which automatically generates a combination of RapiDaemons that mimics the interference profile generated by your real application as it runs on your multicore system. This reduces the effort needed to estimate worst-case timing behavior by letting you bound your analysis by testing your applications against realistic interference profiles.

Airworthiness StandardsThe previous article in this series focused on partitioning in multicore processors. It also looked at guidance for safety certification of Avionics Systems based on multicore processors, including multicore aspects of partitioning, particularly from the FAA CAST-32A position paper. There are several other standards that one may also want to consider, including:RTCA DO-178C âSoftware Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certificationâ â describes the process of developing software that will be flight certifiedRTCA DO-254 âDesign Assurance Guidance for Airborne Electronic Hardwareâ â describes the process of developing complex electronic hardware that will be flight certified. Referenced by AC 20-152.RTCA DO-248C âSupporting Information for DO-178C and DO-278Aâ â provides additional details on concepts in DO-178C, including using previously developed software, MC/DC coverage, independence, and partitioningRTCA DO-297 âIntegrated Modular Avionics (IMA) Development Guidance and Certification Considerationsâ â describes roles and processes for developing IMA systems, and the importance of partitioningARINC 653 Part 1, Supplement 5 â adds support for multicore, but in terms of partitioning and assurance it is clear that âIt must not be construed that compliance to ARINC 653 assures robust partitioningâFAA AC 20-193 âUse of Multi-Core Processorsâ â formalizes the objectives from CAST-32A related to certifying avionics systems based on multicore processors. A draft of this Advisory Circular was released in October 2020. After a comment period, the final version is expected to be published in 2021.US DoD MIL-HDBK-516C âAirworthiness Certification Criteriaâ â provides guidance for certification of avionics systems (including hardware and software). An update is in progress to address multicore considerations, but this has not yet been published.US Army âMulti-Core Processor (MCP) Airworthiness Requirementsâ â this guidance is in draft form and has not yet been formally released.FACE Conformance is not AirworthinessAs explained in previous articles in this series, certification of FACE conformance only guarantees that a Unit of Conformance (UoC) honors the FACE standard. It is not intended as a solution for meeting airworthiness requirements. Indeed, the FACE standard recognizes that some systems do not require safety certification, such as systems built on the FACE General Purpose profile using Linux as the operating system. The Safety- and Safety-Extended profiles intentionally limit the breadth of functionality included in a FACE UoC, which can help limit the scope of effort needed to generate certification evidence, but using this profile is simply a starting point.This brings us to some important conceptual difference when comparing FACE conformance to flight certification (approval of airworthiness). Conformance to the FACE standard is granted to a component, not to an entire system. The FACE Verification Authority (VA) verifies conformance for a UoC, which may be a FACE architectural segment, or part of a segment. A UoC cannot span more than one architectural segment, though a âUoC Packageâ can be comprised of UoCs that span certain FACE segments to form a single logical entity. Thus, FACE conformance is not granted to the entire system, even if it is made up partially or entirely of FACE conformant UoCs. Only the individual UoCs can be claimed to be conformant.On the other hand, airworthiness is granted to an entire system, not to components. Certification artifacts may be associated with one component, such as the OS, and these artifacts may be accumulated into the overall certification package for the aircraft. An individual component can be described as certifiable, or perhaps as certified within a named system, but the stand-alone component cannot be labeled as âcertifiedâ.For example, certification artifacts for Wind River VxWorks 653 v2.5 on PowerPC (which is FACE conformant to the Safety Base Profile against Technical Standard v2.0) include all documentation required to satisfy the requirements of RTCA DO-178C, consisting of over 65,000 hyperlinked files. This includes items such as the Plan for Software Aspects of Certification (PSAC) and Software Accomplishment Summary (SAS) along with all design reviews, code review, test reviews, functional tests and coverage results. In addition to supporting evidence for the OS, there is also evidence for qualified development tools, and for newer releases, evidence supporting CAST-32A for Multicore.FACE Conformance Supports AirworthinessThe job of the FACE UoC supplier is to provide the software as well as associated certification artifacts. The job of the system integrator includes pulling together FACE UoCs to form the overall avionics system design. If acting as the certification applicant, they must also collate the certification artifacts for each UoC into the overall certification package for the system.The FACE Consortium has two committees whose work helps smooth this process. First, the Technical Working Group (TWG) on Software Safety has been active since nearly the beginning of the consortium. Currently led by Glenn Carter and Joe Wlad, this committee has a mandate to ensure that each edition of the FACE Technical Standard does not interfere with subsequent efforts to obtain flight certification. That is, this group uses a âdo no harmâ approach, employing preventative measures and eliminating potential airworthiness issues from the technical standard. Second, the EA-25 Airworthiness committee was formed about a year ago, with a mandate to augment the preventative maintenance of the TWG Safety group, by further identifying how the effort toward FACE Conformance could be leveraged to aid in demonstrating airworthiness. The deliverable for this team is a white paper identifying activities and associated design artifacts generated while pursuing FACE conformance that map to evidence appropriate to support flight certification. Thus âdo no harmâ is expanded to âdo some goodâ. The white paper from this committee is expected sometime in 2021.One high-level example of FACE conformance supporting airworthiness can be found in the FACE reference architecture, which is illustrated below. Both civilian and military airworthiness guidance typically require a software architecture to be defined. A system designed using FACE UoCs inherently builds on a reference architecture that has been publicly reviewed and standardized. The documentation of the architecture, its interfaces, and specification are all artifacts that can contribute to meeting the architecture definition expectations for airworthiness. The system integrator still has some work to do to demonstrate that the architecture is implemented correctly and to ensure architecture-related requirements are reviewed and pass normal verification and validation.A more specific example of FACE conformance supporting airworthiness can be found in the FACE technical standard requirements for time partitioning and space partitioning under the safety and security profiles. The isolation provided by partitioning not only contributes to portability and reusability but also eases certification for Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) systems. A number of airworthiness standards expect partitioning as a means of breaking down a complex system into separate logical components that can be independently and incrementally assured. Partitioning cannot be an afterthought. It is a fundamental mechanism of the computing hardware and RTOS and thus must be part of the design philosophy from the beginning. Because the FACE technical standard requires it, this helps ensure that a development program starts out on the right track. The OSS supplier provides much of the evidence to verify and validate the partitioning environment. The system integrator then must demonstrate that the partitioning environment is implemented and configured appropriately so that the supplier evidence can be accepted. In addition, the system integrator must allocate system resources to partitions and demonstrate that the total resource usage is within the system capacity. Resource allocations include a portion of time on one or more processor cores, a portion of main memory, etc.ToolsFlight certifying a system comprised of FACE conformant elements can be a daunting task. Wind River can support your efforts by supplying the Operating System Segment (OSS) along with certification artifacts (as listed in the FACE library/registry) including DO-178 plans such as the PSAC and Software Development Plan (SDP) as well as verification evidence, such as Software Verification Test Cases and Procedures, and Software Test Results. A qualified development tools suite is also included that allows you to develop, configure, build, debug, test, re-test, and certify each independent application independently, incrementally, and asynchronously.Rapita Systems can support your certification efforts with its suite of verification tools that automate much of the Verification &amp; Validation (V&amp;V) process, including tools for generating unit and system tests, automating test runs and reporting, analyzing structural and decision coverage, and measuring and reporting timing behavior. For multicore systems, Rapita also provides a MACH178 solution that addresses airworthiness for avionics systems by verifying that multicore interference channels are properly mitigated.Learn about the FACE standard and how to comply with it in our blog series:Part 1: How the Operating System Segment fits into the FACE architectureÂ Part 2: FACE Components - Interchangeable but not EqualÂ Part 3: Assured Partitioning for FACE SystemsÂ Part 4: Assured Multicore Partitioning for FACE SystemsÂ Part 5: Leveraging FACE Conformance Artifacts to Support Airworthiness (this post) " href="/blog/leveraging-face-conformance-artifacts-support-airworthiness" target="_blank">

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="Multicore systems are being used more and more in real-time embedded systems for critical software. While these systems offer improved performance, using them makes verification of hosted application's timing behavior challenging due to interference effects caused by contention for shared hardware resources. For multicore systems to be verified on a multicore system, interference channels must be understood, and tests must be run to demonstrate that timing budgets can be met in realistic interference scenarios.Rapita's RVS software, Multicore Timing Solution and MACH178 solution support multicore timing analysis for critical aerospace and automotive software.The Multicore Timing Solution supports the development and verification of multicore systems in the aerospace and automotive domains, supporting use cases such as evaluating multicore platforms, analyzing multicore timing behavior and producing assurance evidence.The MACH178 solution offers an end-to-end solution to support the certification of multicore avionics against DO-178C, A(M)C 20-193 and CAST-32A guidelines.RVS makes multicore timing analysis efficient by automating key stages in the process:RapiTest creates test harnesses to test for multicore timing behavior and runs these on the target hardwareRapiTime instruments the code so execution times and values from Hardware Event Monitors on the hardware can be collected during testsRapiTask can be used to visualize the scheduling behavior of multicore applications and identify rare events such as priority inversions  " href="/products/features/multicore-timing-analysis" target="_blank">

Rapita Systems are proud to be sponsoring the University of York Aerospace and Rocketry society, who are creating a rocket to enter one of the largest international rocketry competitions, the Spaceport America Cup.







The York Aerospace and Rocketry society (YAR) was founded in 2020 by a group of STEM students who are passionate about all things aerospace. AÂ major goal of the society is to compete in major rocketry competitions on the global stage.





YAR was admitted into Spaceport America 2021, where they will launch their rocket, âProject Jorvickâ. Spaceport America is hosted in New Mexico, and every year around 200 teams bring their innovative rockets to compete in different categories at the event. YARâs Jorvick rocket will be competing to make a 10,000-foot ascent, with maximum points scored for reaching exactly 10,000 feet before descending. Extra points can be gained by deploying a payload from the rocket e.g. a weather device or other ballast. The team at YAR will be using the RVS toolsuite to verify the software onboard the Jorvick rocket, which Rapita hopes will improve the teamâs odds of making that precise 10,000-foot ascent!

This presentation was delivered as part of the NXPÂ®-led MultiCore for Avionics (MCFA) group on 2020-11-11.

DO-297/ED-124 gives guidance on DO-178C compliance considerations for Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA). These documents describe an incremental approach to DO-178C acceptance, where different roles produce assurance evidence for a subset of the entire system and this is accumulated to provide an assurance argument for the entire system.

The same approach can be used for incremental assurance of multicore systems.

	Basic concept of modularity, federated vs. integrated, isolation/partitioning
	Relevant standards
	ARINC 653 partitioning of the IMA computing environment
	DO-297/ED-124 IMA stakeholder roles
	CAST-32A, A(M)C 20-193 multicore assurance
	ARINC 664 partitioning of the IMA communication network
	Partitioning environment
	Time, space, bandwidth, resource partitioning
	Partitioning Platform, hosted Partition Applications


How Can We Apply Incremental Acceptance to Multicore?

    OurÂ  previous blog identified the benefits of partitioning and explored assurance of partitioning on a single core. In this fourth blog of the series, we continue with the topic of partitioning, but now with a focus on multicore processors. Avionics system designers and integrators designing to the FACE standard are adopting the MultiCore Processor (MCP) to meet future performance demands. MCP provides the avionics industry with a platform that can provide greater performance in a lower footprint, translating to systems with lower Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP). Regardless of these benefits, OEMs in the avionics industry are pressured to adopt MCP technology when making upgrades to replace legacy single-core designs because nearly every new processor on the market today is based on multicore technology. The benefits of partitioning still hold even when implemented on an MCP, including portability, modularity, reduced integration effort, and reduced certification effort (due to incremental and compartmentalized assurance). However, MCP also introduces additional complexity in implementation and certification. System integrators need guidance on how to be successful. 
  


  
    Guidance for Assurance of Multicore Systems
    
      DO-178C, DO-297, and ARINC 653 were all written in the context of single core processors, so the introduction and use of MCP adds further complexity. The FAA's CAST-32A position paper was the first major publication to address DO-178C/ED-12C assurance for MCPs. This has since been superseded for projects certified with the European Union Safety Agency (EASA) in AMC 20-193 and for projects certified with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in AC 20-193.
    
    
      CAST-32A extends the partitioning concept for multicore processors âRobust Time Partitioning (on an MCP) is achieved when, as a result of mitigating the time interference between partitions hosted on different cores, no software partition consumes more than its allocation of execution time on the core(s) on which it executes, irrespective of whether partitions are executing on none of the other active cores or all of the other active cores.â
    
    Although each US military service has its own airworthiness authority, evidence of airworthiness according to FAA guidelines is often accepted as part of the certification effort. Specifically, CAST-32A is one of the FAA guidance documents that some military programs are currently using when considering the adoption of MCP systems. In addition, starting in 2019, augmentation has been underway on Section 15 âComputer Systems and Softwareâ of MIL-HDBK-516C Airworthiness Certification Criteria. Of the 42 criteria listed in section 15, 20 have been identified as needing augmentation to account for the use of MCPs. An update to MIL-HDBK-516C is expected in the coming year.
    The certification applicant for a FACE conformant system running on a multicore processor will need to meet either civilian flight certification guidelines (such as DO-178C, DO-297, and AC 20-193) and/or military airworthiness guidance (such as the augmented MCP requirements for MIL-HDBK-516C). Conformance to the FACE technical standard in itself does not ensure that these standards are met, though the FACE EA-25 subcommittee is currently working on a white paper to provide more detailed advice on which FACE activities and artifacts may contribute to flight certification evidence for standards such as DO-178C and MIL-HDBK-516C.
  


  
    Assuring Partitioned, Multicore Systems
    When multicore processors first started appearing in avionics, early adopters avoided some of the certification issues by simply deactivating all but one of the cores. This worked, because In many cases that single core offered better performance than older unicore processors. However, as the years have gone by, the individual cores have not improved much further in performance, meaning that significant gains in functionality through higher processor computational throughput can only be achieved more than one of the cores in an MCP.
    Proving the correctness of time-partitioning even on a unicore system is challenging. Although only one partition can run at a time when there is only one core, partitions could still interfere with each other directly by causing unconstrained partition jitter, i.e., variation in the time for each partition scheduled time slot without a deterministic bound. Partitions on single cores can also interfere with each other indirectly. For example, one partition could start an operation using a bus master other than the CPU, such as a DMA engine, whose activity extends past the end of the partitionâs scheduled time slot, and thus overlaps and possibly contends with another partitionâs activity.
    In an MCP system, multiple applications can now run simultaneously, each on its own core. Some resources are private and exclusive to a single core, such as the L1 cache, as shown in the example four-core architecture in Figure 1. However, other resources are shared, such as the L2 cache, main memory, and I/O devices. The applications on different cores can thus contend for access to these shared resources, potentially impact each otherâs performance, which breaks down the isolation between partitions.
  


  
    
      
        
      
      Figure 1: Multicore Computer Architecture Hosting Three Applications
    
  


  
    One simplified approach to achieve time partitioning schedules a single partition at any given time but allows that partition to use more than one core. This approach is limited, as only multithreaded application software can take advantage of multiple cores, while single-threaded cores leave the other cores idle during their time window of the schedule, as shown in Figure 2 .
  


  
    
      
        
      
      Figure 2: Simplified Multicore ARINC653 Schedule Restricted to One Partition at a Time
    
  


  
    Only recently have early adopters of MCPs attempted to use all cores with mixed-criticality software by following the guidance in DO-297 and A(M)C 20-193. Figure 3 illustrates the complex nature of this approach, where multiple independent applications can run within the same partition window (each on its own core), even if the applications are certified at different design assurance levels. In this case, independent partitions with different criticality, i.e., different software levels, are able to run simultaneously, on different cores, within the same minor time frame of the schedule. An example of this complex approach is given by the work Collins Aerospace has done with Wind River as referenced by the White Paper.
    
  


  
    
      
        
      
      Figure 3: Complex Multicore ARNC653 Schedule
    
  


  
    Proving the correctness of time-partitioning on a mixed-criticality multicore system is quite challenging since partitions can run simultaneously on different cores. Independent partitions running on distinct cores now compete for shared resources. That contention can cause delays, thus increasing the softwareâs Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET). While an application running in a partition may meet its requirements when no other cores are active, interference from functions running on other cores may increase the applicationâs WCET to the point that it no longer meets its requirements. A variety of resources may cause such interference because the processor cores share access, including lower levels of cache memory, the main memory, I/O devices, and bus interconnects.
  


  
    A(M)C 20-193 provides guidance on assuring a multicore system. Ten objectives must be met to demonstrate that multicore interference channels have been mitigated. The planned additions to MIL_HDBK-516C also include criteria to analyze interference channels. An interference channel is defined as any property of the computing platform âthat may cause interference between independent applications.â All interference channels within the avionics system must either be eliminated or else their impact must be sufficiently reduced that all applications meet their timing requirements even in the presence of the worst-case level of interference from other cores. Similarly, the MIL-HDBK-516C additions require that âexecution rates provided by the executive/control structure â¦ are consistently obtainable and sufficient to safely provide the required performance.â That is, even in the face of multicore interference, timing requirements must be met. Successfully meeting the objectives of these standards requires both attention to mitigation of interference channels during the early life cycle stage of design and careful attention to measurement methods during the later life cycle stage of verification.
  


  
    Mitigating Multicore Interference
    Mitigation of multicore interference requires that partitions be isolated from each other. Multiple separation mechanisms to achieve partitioning are available to the system designer and integrator, implemented in hardware and/or software.
    Some isolation mechanisms are provided by the hardware. Selecting a processor that gives each core exclusive resources can eliminate contention for them. For example, at least one level of cache memory is typically provided that is distinct and exclusive to each core. For CPU-intensive applications with strong locality of access, a private L1 cache is often sufficient to render the software largely insensitive to interference from other cores. When resources must be shared, the hardware may provide isolation by ensuring equitable access. Even then, one coreâs access may impact access by another core, breaking down the separation. Unfortunately, silicon providers may not provide better determinism in cases like this because it would impact raw performance.
    Although hardware can provide some isolation mechanisms, most processors are designed to optimize the average execution time on all cores, often at the expense of the WCET on any one core. While this is a good trade-off for many commercial applications, it is a problem for safety-critical avionics, as it represents a form of multicore interference. Thus, additional isolation approaches beyond those implemented through hardware are necessary.
    Some isolation mechanisms are provided by the RTOS. A multicore RTOS can manage processor cores, ensuring the usage of any one hosted application is deterministically bounded within its partition so that all applications meet their requirements -- even when multicore interference is present. An example of such an RTOS is the Wind River VxWorks 653 Multi-Core edition.
  


  
    Verifying Mitigation of Multicore Interference
    Verification that multicore interference channels have been mitigated is an essential step in meeting A(M)C 20-193 objectives. Since no one has yet flight certified a civilian aircraft with a mixed-criticality multicore system, approaches to verification are only just appearing. Nevertheless, best practices for verification are emerging based on interference generators.
    Interference generators are carefully crafted software applications with a small code footprint that create high bandwidth use of a targeted resource. For example, Rapita Systems has a library of interference generators called Rapi Daemons that target resources such as a shared L3 cache, DDR main memory, or DMA. These interference generators are used to create inter-core stress on the targeted resource. For example, Figure 4 shows Rapi Daemons running on cores 1, 2, and 3 with the application running on core 0, where the Rapi Daemons create interference for access to the main memory, as well as any shared resource along the logical path to that resource, including interconnects and cache. 
  


  
    
      
        
      
      Figure 4: Measuring Multicore Interference with Rapi Daemon Interference Generators 
    
  


  
    Comprehensive analysis of multicore interference requires the identification of all potential interference channels. The system architecture must be reviewed for shared resources, including potentially obscure or hidden channels where cores can contend, such as interconnects that are not equitably arbitrated or last level caches with insufficient write ports. For each interference channel identified, an interference generator must be designed and calibrated to stress that channel. For systems at the highest design assurance levels, such as DO-178C Levels A and B, this testing must be done with independence.
    The Rapita Systems approach to multicore timing analysis uses two phases within a test methodology for measuring multicore interference channels. The first phase is platform characterization, wherein the platform is defined as both the computational hardware as well as the RTOS. In this phase, we check the outer bounds of possible multicore interference by competing Rapi Daemons against each other on all cores. Because Rapi Daemons are tuned to stress a single targeted shared resource, this provides a signature of the performance possible when cores compete continuously for that resource. This phase can be done even before application software is available. 
    The second test phase is software characterization. Individual software applications intended for use in flight are first measured running alone on a core while the other cores are dormant, providing a baseline measurement of the software timing behavior. Next, we measure the increase in WCET in the presence of Rapi Daemon adversaries running on the other cores. By comparing the WCET with and without the Rapi Daemons adversaries running, we can quantify worst-case multicore interference. Furthermore, the WCET with multicore interference can be compared with system requirements to determine if they are still met -- thus demonstrating whether or not interference channels have been sufficiently mitigated. 
    Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) designed with robust partitioning according to DO-297 allows for the incremental acceptance of assurance evidence, accumulating certification artifacts over the course of several independent verification efforts. That is, we can measure each partition application independently of the others, verifying the mitigation of multicore interference channels. No partition application will produce contention higher than that produced by the Rapi Daemons. The assurance evidence can be collected for each partition application by itself, even though all planned applications will be integrated together in the final system. Furthermore, the timing tests for the existing partitions need not be repeated when new software is added in the future when mapped to in spare partition slots. This incremental verification approach enabled by robust partitioning is a key factor in reducing the number of tests that must be performed. 
    Even with incremental verification benefits, the complexity and number of interference channels in a typical multicore avionics system can still lead to a large number of tests that must be completed. Thus, tool automation is important to keep the schedule and cost of verification reasonably constrained. The Rapita Systems approach to multicore timing analysis automates key stages of the workflow using both Rapi Daemon interference generators and the Rapita Verification Suite software, as illustrated in Figure 5. 
  


  
    
      
        
      
      Figure 5: Tool automation through Rapi Daemons and Rapita Verification Suite Software 
    
  


  
    However, not everything can be automated. Human wisdom from the system and test engineers is still needed to identify interference channels in the system architecture at the start of the process and to properly interpret results at the end of the process.
  


  
    Wrap-up
    System designers and integrators need help to successfully design, integrate, and flight certify modern multicore avionics systems software. Assuring the safety of these systems, e.g., achieving A(MC)C 20-193 (formerly CAST-32A) objectives, can be challenging. Wind River and Rapita Systems can be your guide to success. Wind River provides operating system technology to mitigate interference. Rapita provides a commercial approach for multicore timing analysis using Rapi Daemon interference generators integrated within an automated verification tool suite, which can provide the insights you need early in the project and the artifacts you need to support A(MC)C 20-193 and MIL-HDBK-516C MCP objectives at the end of the project. 
    In our next blog, we will provide an overview of how the activities and artifacts produced while pursuing conformance to the FACE technical standard can also be leveraged toward certification of airworthiness.

One of the biggest themes of the discussion was the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACEâ¢), whose open architecture technical standards can help with achieving safety in the digital battlespace.

Some questions discussed in webinar include:


	How are experts thinking about and applying FACE to build the next generation of avionics standards?
	Why are FACE-conformant technologies interchangeable, and how can you distinguish among them?
	What new safety challenges will we encounter in a digital world where FACE conformance is essential?

We take the quality and testing of our software very seriously â as seriously as you take yours. We take it so seriously that we meet many criteria that aren't required (per DO-330) for qualification of our tools, based on their Tool Qualification Level, TQL-5. We do this because we think itâs good practice, and because it gives us confidence in the quality of our products, which we consider to be just as important to us as it is to our customers. In this blog, we share a few examples of how we ensure this quality.





Requirements-based engineering

A key element of our quality approach is that we take requirements-based development further than is required by DO-330 or ISO 26262. Rather than using only a single set of Tool Operational Requirements for ourÂ RVS tools, we add a second level of detail to these requirements to better ensure that we examine the full scope of tool inputs. This is essential for a tool that deals with the complexities of different programming language standards.

Within that context, we write the developer-TOR, the internal tool requirements, the tool test plans and the tool componentÂ tests, and we manage full upwards and downwards traceability of all of these items. We ensure that all items are reviewed independently and against each other, hence complying with items in DO-330's â Table T-6: Testing of outputs of integration process â. This approach means that we have baselines both for the development and qualification of our tools. This is an example of how we respect the DO-330 criterion â T8-2 Baselines and traceability are established â, for which compliance is not required at TQL5.

This is a very laborious process, but it gives us confidence in understanding exactly how our tools behave, giving credence to the claim that we take quality very seriously.

Testing and automation

Weâve developed our own test harness and infrastructure that lets us fully automate running our tests. We run our full testing suite (a close equivalent to running system acceptance tests) multiple times daily as part of our in-house continuous build system. This reduces the risk of human error and lets us run tests often and detect any defects early in development.

We run state-of-the art testing â not only of nominal cases, but also of robustness cases, range cases etc. Our full qualification kit test suite includes over 180,000 lines of code. Of course, it isnât just about the quantity of test code, but about testing the right components of our tools, and we have this covered â for example, we test nested decisions up to a nesting depth of 80 to ensure that our tools work with rare (but possible) corner cases. This gives us visibility and confidence in the completeness of our test suite.

Configuration management process

We use version control and issue-tracking (bug) management systems. This respects the DO-330 criterion â T8-3 Problem reporting, change control, change review, and configuration status accounting are established â, which we meet even though itâs not needed at TQL-5. Whenever we fix a bug in our software, we write a test demonstrating that the bug is no longer present. We then add this to our growing suite of regression tests to ensure that we never reintroduce past errors in our software.

We maintain our tool life cycle environment under revision control, and we tag it automatically as part of the tool release process. This complies with another DO-330 criterion thatâs optional for us â â T8-5 Tool life cycle environment control is established â â and helps us provide support to customers using previous versions of our tools. We also tag and securely store all of our tool releases for future use or reference. Finally, we can (and sometimes do) re-run the release process and compare the built artifacts with the ones we storedÂ previously to ensure that we are able to rebuild superseded releases.

Plans and standards

We have internal processes that we apply to tool releases and non-conformance scenarios, and we perform periodic internal audits. We also have internal coding standards, requirements standards, and testing standards that we follow and audit against. This meets the DO-330 criterion â T9-1 Assurance is obtained that tool plans and standards are developed and reviewed for consistency â.

Assurance issues

There is no software without bugs. We do everything we can to find defects in our tools as early as possible and fix them. If we find defects that affect our assurance case, we let you know about them instead of hiding them, as is well explained in our post on our Assurance Issue process.

Conclusion

At Rapita, we donât just do what we must to develop and qualify our tools, we do everything we think is important to deliver quality tools that weâre confident about, so that you can rely on them for your software verification.

Whatever your tool qualification needs are, we believe that we can meet them. We currently offer tool qualification support for the use of RVS tools in DO-178B, DO-178C and ISO 26262 projects. For more information, visit our qualification page or contact us.

You can get started writing tests in RapiTest's spreadsheet format easily using RapiTest's template test generator.

This creates template tests that you can fill in, so you don't need to start from scratch.

When creating a template, you can select the function(s) that you want to test, which will be included in the generated template. If you know the input values you want to provide for your test function(s), or return values you want to check against, you can provide these and the test generator will add these to your template. You can also set any configuration settings you'd like to apply to your tests, such as whether you want them disabled by default.

Critical embedded software must often be tested for functional correctness, and must meet the constraints of the hardware it will run on, the first being achieved by a combination of testing methods including unit testing, and the second by timing analysis.

These are often carried out separately by different groups of engineers, with little or no communication between the two.Â 

Being able to produce timing data during unit testing allows timing optimization, and the identification ofÂ potential issues, earlier during the development process, particularly if unit tests are run from an early stage.

You can do this using both RapiTestÂ and RapiTimeÂ together.

I started working with Rapita Systems in January on a part-time basis while I finished my degree in Computer Science at the University of York. When the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the lockdown in March, I began to work from home for both Rapita and the final parts of my university course. This made my full-time start at Rapita in June a particularly interesting one; I have adapted to attending online meetings and providing remote integration work while settling in with the company and learning about our products. I am not alone in this situation, as a growing company, we have had a number of new starters, including permanent staff and interns, join during the lockdown period.





The challenges of starting a job remotely were made much smaller by the close co-operation and communication within the company, and the willingness of all colleagues to assist one another and to pass on their knowledge of the product and the field. If I have a technical problem, or come across something I don't yet understand, I send a message to my colleagues in the Field Application Engineering team and usually receive an explanation or help via a screen-share. When I need more help, itâs easy to reach out to the developer responsible for a specific tool or feature, to operations for licensing and financial queries, or to IT for technical help.


 

Home office setup





From my first days at Rapita, I have been involved in real projects with the support of my team. The first piece of work I undertook was to create a demonstration of Ada support in the RVS tools. This highlights the ability of the RVS tools to instrument and report on mixed language programs. The program used in the demonstration is written in Ada and C and targets the VxWorks 7 operating system running on a Xilinx Zynq SoC. With feedback from AdaCore, development of this demonstration is ongoing, with a view to using it to demonstrate the libadalang support in RVS.






Joe configuring RTBx tracing



I have also worked on an on-target multicore integration. I integrated RapiCover and RapiTest into an environment that already had a RapiTime and RapiTask integration. Data extraction for this target was especially complex due to the limited I/O facilities on the target. An RTBx had already been configured to provide a trace for a RapiTime integration, so I used the RTBx to transmit the map containing the coverage and test information from the board.



Sending a complex data structure through a data logging tool is challenging, as errors in the transfer can cause the retrieved data to be incorrect and unusable. The oversampling and strobe functionality of the RTBx means that a robust mechanism for retrieving the map data could be implemented.





Following the successful use of the RVS tools on the Solar Orbiter (SolO) Energy Particle Detector EPD module, I have been working alongside engineers from the University of AlcalÃ¡ to replicate their development environment and their RVS integration. The purpose of this work is to build upon their RVS integration, to enhance the test setup for the SolO software, and to develop a comprehensive demonstration and test platform for RVS based on an exciting real-world project. The RapiCover integration has been replicated and improved upon, and integrations with the rest of the suite are the next step. My full-time start might have been a slightly unconventional one, but it has been interesting and enjoyable nonetheless. I look forward to seeing what the future holds for me at Rapita!

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="IntroductionThe Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACEâ¢) consortium will host its annual Technical Interchange Meeting and Exhibition in March 2021. Leading up to this event,Â Wind RiverÂ andÂ Rapita SystemsÂ are providing some background on the FACE architecture with a focus on our âone-stop shoppingâ ecosystem for Units of Portability (UoP) and the tools to test, integrate, and certify systems based on the FACE Technical Standard. The first article covered âHow the Operating System Segment fits into the FACE architecture.â This is the second blog in the series.The US Department of Defense continues to push for the use of open architecture solutions as a means to get better avionics hardware into the field more quickly and at lower cost. One source of such solutions is the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACEâ¢) consortium, which publishes an open architecture technical standard as well as business models for implementing the standard in avionics systems. The publications released by the FACE Consortium are alsoÂ publicly available and free to download.In this second blog of the series, we focus on the benefits of modularity in an open architecture and discuss the features that distinguish offerings by different vendors, with a focus on the Operating System Segment (OSS) component of the FACE architecture. In relation to OSS,Â Wind RiverÂ provides a competitive advantage while maintaining modularity. Part of that advantage is a rich ecosystem of tools to validate the performance of the system and provide assurance evidence for airworthiness. Since the OSS is foundational to the architecture, it is important that the ecosystem for it is closely aligned with the operating system. For example, flight certification of multicore avionics systems require assurance that multicore interference channels have been mitigated. The Rapita Systems CAST-32A Compliance Package provides that assurance with tools and artifacts that validate and verify the system.FACE Modularity leads to InterchangeabilityThe modular concepts of the FACE standard provide a reference architecture based on segments that can be integrated to meet final system requirements. Variations in the content of each segment, including application code, allows the system architect flexibility in designing and building the end system out of compatible modules. The FACE standard defines the logical interfaces between these segments to allow for modularity. Â This promotes the re-use of software components and enables common functionality across military systems. By using the defined API standards (as described in our previous blog) this allows components to be easily moved between conformant systems developed by different vendors.In order to ensure the segments can be used in a modular fashion, it is vital that components are tested against the applicable FACE Standard. Conformance is verified by checking that a component conforms to the FACE Technical standard as a âUnit of Conformanceâ or âUoCâ. (The term âUnit of Portabilityâ is sometimes used instead of âUnit of Conformanceâ to highlight the portable aspects of these components.) This is done by running a FACE Conformance Test Suite, achieving certification of conformance through reviews by a FACE Verification Authority and a FACE Certification Authority, and registering the result on the FACE Registry with the FACE Library AdministratorTwo examples of certificates of conformance for Units of Conformance (UoCs) tested against different FACE Profiles are shown below:If a system architect starts designing a system and needs to use an OS with a specific profile, then they can look at the FACE Registry and choose one of the UoCs that have been certified against that profile. Â There are multiple revisions of the FACE Technical Standard, so a Version Number is also specified for each product in the registry. The certificates shown are for UoCs for the âGeneral Purpose Profileâ and âSafety Base Profileâ, both against âTechnical Standard 3.0â.A System Architect will typically choose several UoCs that will integrate into the final software system. Of note here is that several UoCs could coexist within the same processor address space, and so integration considerations and coordination of these UoC is vital. This is particularly true of performance and interference challenges at integration time. FACE conformance testing only checks the UoC against an OSS profile and within a single segment, and so will not check all software behavior or performance. Itâs also worth noting that if you have several UoCs, then you would need UoC to UoC communications, which requires use of the FACE Transport Services Interface. Inter-UoC communication is illustrated in the figure below from the FACE Technical Standard 3.0.Benefits of InterchangeabilityThe FACE approach aligns well with the concept of Open Systems Architectures (OSA). The OSA approach enables several business drivers:Better buying powerMore affordabilityFaster time to deployRapid capability injectionSoftware reuseOne interesting aspect of the FACE Consortia was the early decision to develop not only a Technical Standard, but also a Business Standard that provides Guidance in the Value Proposition and Business Case for the FACE Approach. This is currently at Version 2.0 and is available on theÂ FACE Documents Web Site.Being certified conformant to UoC in the FACE standard provides confidence that system integrators have choices â they can drop a particular UoC from any vendor into their system and it should work âout of the boxâ with other components Â This fulfills several of the business drivers, reuse of components, rapid capability injection, and more affordability as the cost of development of the UoC is spread across several programs. An added benefit is that the system integration cost should also be lower due to the well-defined layers between UoC within the standard.Competition is generated between vendors to provide their value -add and capability expertise, while still conforming to the FACE standard. This in turn gives government procurement agents better buying power when looking for alternative or complementary solutions.At the same time, it means that the Government is no longer stuck with one vendor and breaks out of vendor lock-in, choosing the best solution rather than being forced into using the same vendor.For vendors producing products, this also provides benefits of standardization across projects, reducing development cost risk and schedule slips that could impact multiple programs. The reuse of components means better return on investment, and allows vendors to focus on their core strengths and innovation.However, having functional components that adhere to the standard does not provide all you need. Â Each will have different performance, quality, certification artifacts, and tools. Each will also have different business models and lifecycle support solutions. Theses must be taken into account when making final selections.Interchangeability is the MinimumThe benefits of interchangeable parts are clear in everyday society. Â Metric wrenches all fit a metric socket. Â Street legal automobiles all fit on public roads. The benefits of such standardization are clear for wrenches and cars. Â The benefits for software are also clear. Â However, interchangeable parts set the minimum expectation. All wrenches should fit their sockets and all automobiles should fit the road. All wrenches, however, vary in strength and durability and all cars vary in top speed and fuel efficiency. So too, interchangeability for standardized software is the minimum. An OSS that is certified to be conformant to the FACE Technical standard has merely been shown to âfit the roadâ. Specifically, the Application Programming Interface (API) specified by the standard confirms that the software components that make up the system will fit together and communicate with each other correctly. This compatibility in itself, however, does not indicate anything about the quality of the component, such as its speed or efficiency.Thus, interchangeability through conformance to standards such as the FACE Technical Standard is the ticket for entry to the FACE market, but this is the minimum. Vendors that meet this starting criterion for a specific FACE UoC compete on a level playing field. For example, customers seeking a FACE OSS will likely make decisions on purchasing based on the following:Performance: Components produced by different vendors will vary in the performance metrics, such as end-to-end latency, response time, determinism, reliability, etc.Certification: Conformance to the FACE technical standard may provide some testing and artifacts that may be useful for demonstrating airworthiness, but this is only a start. The packages offered by vendors in support of flight certification will vary. On this note, the FACE EA-25 subcommittee is currently working on a white paper to provide more detailed advice on which FACE activities and artifacts may contribute to flight certification evidence.Ecosystem: The tools associated with each vendor will vary widely. Especially for the OSS, a rich ecosystem of tools is important to the successful development and integration of the system. The standardization provided by the FACE technical standard can sometimes mean that tools work across any vendor offering, but this is not always the case, as tools may need to connect âunder the hoodâ as well. Â Example tools include the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), debugging tools, testing tools (including unit, system, requirements-based), structural coverage analysis tools, timing analysis tools, requirements traceability tools, and etc.Wind River, together with ecosystem partners such as Rapita Systems can help you build a FACE system with the performance and determinism you need, along with the assurance artifacts you need to achieve flight authorization cost-effectively.Assuring PartitioningThe FACE Standard Requires PartitioningThe FACE standard calls for support for time and space partitioning in its Safety and Security Profiles. Partitioning is an isolation technique used in many types of computing systems. Â This technique supports modularity, for example through Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA). Â The separation properties provided by the partitioning of distinct applications are essential to achieve the promise of the FACE standard.With the advent of powerful multi-core processors, the drive to use partitioning to separate critical applications is accelerating. With single core processors, the ability to host applications at different criticalities was achieved using Time &amp; Space Partitioning, in an Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) architecture developed to overcome issues of Space, Weight, and Power (SWaP) in commercial aircraft. This was needed to meet the increasing requirements for more and more capability within common airframes at the time, such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 787. However, on a unicore system, the CPU resource was shared (time-sliced) across multiple applications, and while this achieved the goals of an IMA Architecture, it also impacted the performance allocated to applications. With the latest multicore applications, this performance impact can be mitigated by allocation across multiple cores. At the same time, the use of multicore introduces new challenges to assuring airworthiness.The FACE Standard does not Assure PartitioningAlthough the FACE technical standard requires partitioning in several of its defined profiles, the standard only requires an interface to a partitioned operating environment (ARINC 653). It does not require assurance that the environment correctly implements the isolation mechanisms that provide the primary benefit of partitioning. This makes sense as the FACE technical standard is intended to foster interchangeability and modularity. It is not a substitute for flight certification, but only a starting point. The FACE EA-25 Airworthiness subcommittee is currently working on a white paper to âensure that FACE conformant software, associated artifacts, and the process to produce them â¦ contribute towards evidence of Air Worthiness where possible, explicitly citing common requirements, processing and guidance.âThe system integrator would be wise to consider the significant hurdles to prove airworthiness from the earliest stages of design, especially for features central to the overall architecture, such as partitioning. When implemented correctly, partitioning simplifies integration and certification because each partition can be considered one at a time. Â However, this approach requires that the partitioning itself is proven to a very high level of rigor. Rigorous isolation of partitions is not something that can be tacked on at the end: it must be incorporated as a fundamental design feature from the beginning. Â Certification of software for Civilian flight in the US and Europe is guided by the RTCA DO-178C/ED-12C standard. The DO-297 and ARINC 653 standards provide guidance on partitioning environments to isolate independent software functions. Military airworthiness authorities use similar approaches to evaluate software.The challenge to assure the isolation of partitions is even greater for computing platforms that use multicore processors. On a unicore processor, only one partition can run at a time, providing some natural isolation. On a multicore processor, partitions can run simultaneously on different cores, creating multiple channels of potential interference between functions. Multicore interference can degrade the isolation between partitions and thus must be mitigated. This is a relatively new technology. Â The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) currently provides guidance for assuring multicore systems in a position paper, CAST-32A. Â Further guidance is expected from the FAA and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) sometime in the next year.Wrap upConformance to the FACE technical standard demonstrates compatibility and interchangeability, forming the basis for a level playing field of competitive products. Smart OSS buyers will require such conformance, but then will carefully evaluate conformant products on characteristics such as performance, robustness of partitioning, and quality of flight certification artifacts.This may lead us to questions like the following. What are the steps toward assurance of partitioning in a system composed of FACE UoCs? Â What are the best practices that can lead to a cost-effective approach that is successfully certified for flight? This is the subject of the next blog in this series.

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="OverviewThe Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACEâ¢) consortium will host their annual Technical Interchange Meeting and Exhibition in September 2020. Leading up to this event, Wind River and Rapita Systems are providing some background on the FACE architecture with a focus on our âone stop shoppingâ ecosystem for Units of Portability (UoP) and the tools to test, integrate, and certify systems based on the FACE Technical Standard.The US Department of Defense continues to push for the use of open architecture solutions as a means to get better avionics hardware into the field more quickly and at lower cost. One source of such solutions is the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACEâ¢) consortium, founded in 2010 to develop an open architecture technical standard as well as business models for implementing FACE standards in systems. The consortium is managed by the Open Group, and has members from government, education, and industry sectors. Â Member organizations must be incorporated in the US and individual members must be US citizens, though the annual FACE Technical Interchange Meeting typically includes an exhibition that is open to all. Â The publications released by the FACE Consortium are alsoÂ publicly available and free to download. Â There are currently 91 organizations and over 1,000 individuals with membership. The consortium sponsors four general working sessions a year, called the FACE F2F. Â Volunteer members do the detailed work of the consortium through technical and business working groups overseen by a steering committee and advisory board.One of the most significant products of the FACE consortium has been the development of a technical standard, which is currently at revision 3.0 Â According to theÂ FACE website, âThe FACE Technical Standard is the open avionics standard for making military computing operations more robust, interoperable, portable and secure. The standard enables developers to create and deploy a wide catalog of applications for use across the entire spectrum of military aviation systems through a common operating environment.âIn this first entry of our 4-part blog series, we will summarize the FACE architecture to illustrate how the Operating System Segment (OSS) provides a foundation to the other segments. Later blogs will explore the Wind River OSS in more detail as well as the Rapita Systems tools that support validation and verification.FACE Architectural SegmentsThe concept of the FACE standard is to provide a reference architecture based on segments, which can be composed to meet the final system requirements. Variations in the content of the segments, including application code, allows the system architect flexibility in designing and building the end system. FACE provides the logical interfaces between these segments to allow for portability and re-use.Â FACE Technical Standard (TS) V3Â shows in Figure 1 how the segments are related:Â The five segments are:Operating System Segment (OSS) â foundational services provided by an Operating System; we will cover this in more detail below. Â The remaining four segments depend on the OSS and thus it is shown beneath the others in the diagram.I/O Services Segment (IOSS) â normalizes the interface to I/O devicesPlatform-Specific Services Segment (PSSS) â provides platform services, such as data services, logging, health management and graphics (interface to GPU)Transport Services Segment (TSS) â provides communication servicesPortable Components Segment (PCS) â offers capability or business logicKey to constructing the system are the interfaces between these segments defined by the FACE TS. For the OSS we are interested in the supported APIs, and these fit into different profiles. These are Security, Safety, and General Purpose.Security is most restricted and has a minimal set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for high assurance applications.Safety profile is a superset of the security profile, with more APIs, and is intended for applications that require safety certification, this also has 2 further profiles, Base and Extended.General Purpose profile has most APIs and supports applications that do not necessarily need RT or deterministic response.To maintain commonality across different FACE component suppliers, solutions are tested against these API sets and given aÂ certificate of conformance. For example, Wind River has FACE 2.1 conformance for VxWorks 653 Safety Base Profile, FACE 3.0 conformance for Helix Virtualization Platform (Security &amp; Safety Base Profile) and FACE 3.0 for Wind River Linux (General Purpose Profile).In fact,Â Wind River VxWorks 653Â was the first product to go through FACE certification, and Wind River Linux is theÂ only Linux to achieve FACE Conformance.The FACE standard builds on existing standards rather than creating new ones, so for the OSS it builds on the POSIX and ARINC 653 standards.PartitioningThe FACE standard also calls for support for Partitioning, depending on the profile. This techniques is used in many types of computing systems, a good white paper on this is âEnabling the migration to Future Aerospace &amp; Defense Systemsâ Partitioning supports modularity, including support for the concept of Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA). Â The isolation properties provided by the partitioning of distinct applications are essential to achieve the promise of the FACE standard. Â Why is this? First, interoperability and smooth integration require isolation so that there are no surprises (due to unanticipated interactions) when we add new independent functions in the system. Second, certification of mixed-criticality systems is founded on the isolation of partitions.The General Purpose profile uses space partitioning, while the safety and security profiles require both time and space partitioning. These requirements stem from the ARINC 653 standard for the safety profiles, from the standard âTime partitioning must be used when running Safety Profile-based software components that are dependent upon an ARINC 653 operational environment.âWith the advent of powerful multi-core processors, the drive to use partitioning to separate critical application is accelerating. With single core processors, the ability to host applications at different criticalities was achieved using Time &amp; Space Partitioning, in an Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) architecture developed to overcome issues of Space, Weight, and Power (SWaP) in commercial aircraft. This was needed to meet the increasing requirements for more and more capability within the airframes at the time, such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 787.However, what this basically did was âshareâ the CPU resource across multiple applications, and while this achieved the goals of an IMA Architecture, it also impacted the performance allocated to applications. With the latest multicore applications however, this performance impact can be mitigated by allocation across multiple cores. These systems are breaking ground onÂ safety certification of complex systemsNo Performance RequirementsThe FACE standard intentionally avoids dictating performance or quality of applications, focusing instead on a standard interface with defined behavior. Â This open standards approach has a significant benefit, leveling the playing field. All vendors must meet the same API and must then compete on performance, quality, tools support, depth of airworthiness evidence, etc. For example, multiple vendors might provide a FACE OSS that has been certified conformant to the FACE technical standard, with each providing the same expected API to interface with other elements of the system. However, the timing characteristics â such as response time, partition window jitter, etc. â may vary widely between systems produced by different vendors. Some vendors might provide a package of flight certification artifacts, while others do not, and the strength of the tools ecosystem related to the OSS may vary significantly between vendors.Wrap upWind River and Rapita Systems can help you build your FACE system with our âone stop shoppingâ ecosystem, starting with the Wind River OSS and including the tools to test/integrate/certify systems based on the FACE Technical Standard, such as the Rapita Systems Verification Suite and MACH178Â solution.

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="In the development of a real-time control system, the timing requirements themselves are typically much harder to develop than the corresponding functional requirements. The amount of time taken depends on a huge number of hardware and software architecture factors. As a WCET analysis tool, RapiTime can help to show that execution time aspects of low-level requirements are consistent (DO-178B/C 6.3.2b) and that software partitioning integrity is achieved (DO-178B/C 6.3.3f). The key is to introduce execution time measurement as early as possible in the development lifecycle. For low-level requirements, we recommend a process of setting a budget (based on the overall scheduling requirements, past experience and perhaps some rough calculations) and evaluating early builds of the software against this budget. For this type of analysis, simple end-to-end measurements will be sufficient. RapiTime can produce an execution time profile showing the distribution of execution times for each of the tasks in the system. This reveals issues such as budget much too high, budget much too low, unexpected execution time variation or execution times that are clustered close to the defined budget. From this information, you can adjust budgets and identify specific execution time risks to monitor as the software implementation develops. Testers can also get involved at this stage, providing worst-expected data loads and interfering concurrent behaviour to show that the execution time requirements work together at the level of the software design.



For partitioning integrity, the issue is to demonstrate that the software for each partition cannot escape the confines of that partition. In the time domain, this is a combination of several aspects:


	showing that software within the partition is schedulable, by feeding the WCET values from RapiTime into the schedulability analysis appropriate to the scheduling;
	showing that partition switches occur when expected, which can be obtained from the RapiTime trace for each partition;
	showing that the only software executing in the time-slot for an allocation is software that was intended for that partition. With a combination of trace analysis and instrumentation partitioning, additional confidence may be obtained that the partitions are achieving temporal isolation.


Automated, early checks provides a valuable, independent check of the health of the system being developed. Earlier use of RapiTime gives the added benefit of allowing more lead-time to customise tool operation and instrumentation to achieve minimal pessimism in the reported figures.

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="The efficiency of our tools is an important way in which we can offer our customers savings in terms of time and money. We are constantly refining our tools to improve this efficiency, which has recently included the adoption of new Ada language processing technology. The incorporation of libadalang will allow quicker support of new language features and speed up the analysis of customer code, especially for larger projects.

Background: Parsing in RVS

Rapita Verification Suite (RVS) contains a range of products to help customers analyze and test critical software, providing tools for instrumentation of timing and coverage, tracing, test generation and static analysis. These tools share a preparation database that contains an abstract representation of all the source code for a given customer project. Currently Rapita supports Ada, C, C++ and several assembly languages. A language-specific parser reads a source file and puts a representation of the code in the database. The structure is shown below.



Once the project is in the database, separate analysis tools can be run as needed, including interactive ones that allow you to guide the activity. This structure allows parsers and tools to be added or extended without disrupting anything else. In the rest of this article, we consider the process of safely changing an existing parser. We shall describe how and why Rapita changed the parser for C and C++, without disrupting customersâ work, and how it will do the same for Ada.

The evolution of programming languages

C and C++ support was originally provided by separate ad-hoc parsers. Programming languages are periodically revised, introducing new language rules and constructions, which customers wish to use (often to support third-party libraries). The ad-hoc parsers became hard to extend and maintain to track those changes. Two years ago, Rapita developed a replacement parser based on a production C and C++ compiler that would support those languages as they stood, and as they continued to evolve.

That new support for C and C++ was introduced carefully. First, it had to pass the same extensive suite of end-to-end tests as the existing parsers. Next, the old and new components were provided side-by-side, with the old ones used by default. The new one could, however, be selected explicitly, allowing its use for new integrations, but with a fallback available to the old components if necessary. Eventually, existing integrations also used the new component, and the old was deprecated. Finally, the old one was discarded. The Rapita tools continued to take their input from the database and could remain unchanged.

In a similar way to C and C++, Ada too has evolved: Ada 83, 95, 2005, 2012 and soon 2020. Unlike the ad-hoc parsers originally used for C and C++, Rapitaâs Ada processing uses the GNAT Ada compiler, which does track language changes. As part of the process, however, GNAT produces an elaborate intermediate form (ASIS) that has begun to creak with age. A separate Rapita program converts ASIS into database entries. Adding support for more language features has not always been straightforward, and the two-stage process is relatively slow and inefficient since the extra intermediate form must be written out by GNAT and read back in by the conversion program.

Harnessing the power of libadalang






AdaCore, GNATâs author, has developed a new library libadalang specifically written to make it easier to build tools to work with Ada programs, for example better IDEs. Rapita is using libadalang to build a replacement for the GNAT-based Ada processing in the pipeline shown above. From a customerâs perspective, this will allow quicker support of new language features. Avoiding significant IO between two separate programs reduces the clock time taken to produce the preparation database, speeding up the analysis of customer code, especially for larger projects. Finally, the process for introducing the new component will mimic the one described above, successfully used for C and C++, to ensure a smooth transition.

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="The multicore revolution and DO-178CSince its inception in the 1980âs, the guidance offered by DO-178 and its successors has served the avionics industry well. DO-178B, published in 1992, and more recently DO-178C (2011), have kept pace with changes in avionics hardware by ensuring that their guidelines remain generic and relevant regardless of software architecture, programming language, etc.Since DO-178 was first published, the embedded computing world has seen many significant changes, for example Mooreâs Law having driven advances such that the computing power of modern cellphones now exceeds that of the Apollo 11 lunar lander many times over. One of the most significant changes is the innovation and use of multicore processors. With a higher density of silicon, these systems offer increased performance per unit area, which is critical to meet the needs of modern avionics systems. Their use comes at a price, as unlike single core systems, they offer neither a deterministic environment nor predictable software execution times.In response to the increased use of multicore processors, the Certification Authorities Software Team (CAST) published Position Paper CAST-32A named âMulti-core Processorsâ (often referred to as just âCAST-32Aâ). This paper identified topics that could impact the safety, performance and integrity of airborne software systems executing on multicore processors and provides objectives intended to guide the production of safe multicore avionics systems. This guidance has been superseded by official guidance â for DO-178C projects certified by the FAA in AC 20-193, and for ED-12C project certified by EASA in AMC 20-193.Objective MCP_Software_1 in AC 20-193, AMC 20-193 and CAST-32A requires that evidence is produced to demonstrate that all hosted software components function correctly and have sufficient time to complete their execution when operating in their multicore environment. This white paper outlines the challenges in demonstrating this and presents a practical solution to do so, which is compliant with DO-178C,Â AC 20-193, AMC 20-193 and CAST-32A.Many OEMs are concerned about the long-term component availability of single core processors. This has led some to adopt multicore processors but disable all but one core, as they canât economically verify the system when all cores are enabled.This isnât a good long-term solution and doesnât take advantage of the performance improvements offered by using multicore hardware to its full potential. The challenges of using multicore processors in the critical embedded domain should be tackled head on, and the potential of these processors embraced.If you're interested in multicore timing analysis for DO-178C, why not register for one of our upcoming CAST-32A Training Courses?

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="Determining worst-case execution time (WCET) is a recommended activity for avionics systems developed according to the DO-178B or DO-178C guidelines. This white paper assesses the current state of practice for determining WCET when working to these guidelines and introduces the benefits that arise from being able to automate this process. With its DO-330 qualification kit, RapiTime (part of the Rapita Verification Suite) is unique in allowing these benefits to be realized for DO-178B/C developments.

Determination of worst-case execution time (WCET) is an activity that is recommended in DO-178B and DO-178C 6.3.4f. Here we consider the current state of practice for determining WCET and present the benefits available from automating the process. Thanks to its DO-330 qualification kit, RapiTime uniquely allows these benefits to be realized in DO178B/C projects.

RapiTime is a tool to determine the execution time of embedded software. It reports measured maximum, high water mark and calculated worst-case times. The WCET calculation is based on measured data, annotations and the source code structure.

To use RapiTimeâs calculated WCET in support of DO-178B or DO-178C objective 6.3.4f, it is necessary both to qualify the tool and to provide a corresponding analysis process.

One approach to determining WCET that is widely used and currently accepted by certification authorities is manual analysis and measurement. Manual analysis and measurement is an effort-intensive task and requires an extremely high level of care to ensure measurements are correctly captured.

By using automation to reduce the level of effort required and increase the accuracy of results, RapiTime represents an evolution of the manual analysis and measurement approach. With the introduction of the DO-178B/DO-330 qualification pack, RapiTime can replace manual activities in projects requiring DO-178B/DO-178C certification.

The development of the new qualification pack means RapiTime is the only tool in the marketplace capable of measurement-based WCET analysis for DO-178B.

This white paper describes:


	What is required for WCET in DO-178B and DO-178C projects.
	The current state of practice, and its limitations.
	How RapiTime represents an improvement on the state of practice.
	How to use RapiTime in a DO-178B or DO-178C environment.

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="To meet DO-178B &amp; DO-178C requirements, testing during the development of airborne software should be supported with structural code coverage measurements. This paper sets out eight key code coverage questions for engineers working on embedded real-time avionics systems, before introducing a software tool â RapiCover â which is designed to conduct code coverage measurement on an embedded avionics target.

Supporting the test process with measurements of structural code coverage is a key activity for DO-178B and DO-178C compliance during the development of software for airborne systems. In this white paper we consider eight key questions:


	What is code coverage and how does it benefit my project?
	Should we do on-target or on-host coverage?
	What are the challenges to on-target code coverage and how can we overcome them?
	How can I use my code coverage results to support certification?
	What additional benefits are derived from measuring on-target?
	How do I combine results from multiple tests?
	How do I deal with missing code coverage?
	What should I look for in a code coverage tool?


After we have addressed these eight key questions, we introduce RapiCover, a software tool designed to efficiently perform structural coverage analysis on code running on an embedded target. The benefits of using RapiCover to conduct structural coverage analysis on an embedded target include:


	Reduced timescales by running fewer on-target tests. Very lightweight instrumentation means more coverage information per test cycle.
	Reduced risk through greater tool flexibility. Adapt RapiCover to work with your system, rather than adapting your system to work with another tool. Collect coverage information via a wide variety of mechanisms, making it easier to integrate RapiCover into your system.
	Reduced effort for certification activities. Automatic combination of results from multiple test runs and the ability to justify missing coverage makes the preparation of coverage quicker.

Some channels may be eliminated by architectural analysis or because they are deactivated for your system. For all channels that have not been eliminated, the guidance requires that multicore timing analysis be done to ensure that software operates within its timing deadlines. For each channel, one must provide analysis test reports and a summary to show that the set of tests is complete â Rapita provides this service to show completeness.Â Note that AC 20-193 and AMC 20-193 include objectives other than testing, such as planning objectives.

After running your tests, RapiTestâ¯displays your requirements coverage and the status of each test tagged with each requirement, and lets you export your results in RapiTestâ¯exports. If you're using Jenkins or Bamboo, you can view your requirements coverage in each build and follow the trend in requirements coverage throughout your project.Â

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="How DDC-I and Rapita can provide an end-to-end solution for addressing AC 20-193, AMC 20-193 and CAST-32A objectivesÂ How to integrate the RVS toolsuite on Deos for on-target safety-critical timing analysis.How to use RapiTask and RapiTime to automate the collection of verification results for multicore timing analysis.How RapiDaemon interference generators operate, using an example demonstrating the value of Deosâs Cache Partitioning and its ability to reduce interference and WCET.A technical webinarA primary challenge designers of modern avionics systems face today is how to implement an efficient means of verifying multicore systems. Specifically, one of the more daunting multicore development tasks is to quantify and optimize an applicationâs worst-case execution times â especially in the context of multicore interference caused by applications running on other cores that share common resources (e.g. cache, memory, etc.). Up to now, most avionics companies have had to develop or integrate their own tooling for this capability.This webinar addresses this critical but basic multicore system need. Rapita Systems, developer of software tools for on-target verification, optimization and code coverage analysis of critical real-time embedded systems, and DDC-I, supplier of DO-178 certifiable software and tools for safety critical avionics software developers, partner to offer an âout-of-the-boxâ integration combining DDC-Iâs Deos (time and space partitioned RTOS) with Rapitaâs RapiTime (on-target timing) and RapiTask (scheduling visualization and analysis). This not only works on traditional single-core deployments but also for multicore systems running Deos.DDC-I has been refining Deosâs DAL-A multicore strategy and features for well over a decade, developing an RTOS that effectively addresses the objectives of CAST-32A. Deosâs use of advanced technologies â such as cache partitioning â enables greater performance to be harnessed in the multicore system, whilst also maintaining re-use and functional capabilities.Rapita has worked closely with DDC-I to develop this seamless, hardware-agnostic integration of RVS with Deos, which is portable to every architecture supported by Deos (PowerPC, ARM, and x86). In this approach, tracing is accomplished by applying RVS instrumentation with a trace mechanism available within the Deos kernel. Further, RapiDaemons (interference generators) provide the means to simulate applications running on other cores and imposing upon shared resources. Together, all of these capabilities enable the integrator to qualify Deos-based multicore systems and determine how to best arrange multicore applications for optimal systems performance.

Interference can affect execution timing behavior (including WCET), as identified in the MCP_Software_1 objective of AC 20-193, AMC 20-193 and CAST-32A.Rapita's Multicore Timing Solution provides the means for verifying that interference effects on the final hosted software are understood and bounded. By identifying and quantifying any interference in the system developed on the partitioned system, Rapita can help companies deliver an assessment of the robustness of the system, demonstrate it is free from interference and provide evidence of WCET to certification authorities.Examine partitioning mechanisms on Wind River's VxWorksÂ® ARINC 653 RTOS.How to reduce interference between tasks on different cores.How Rapita demonstrates mitigation strategies are effective.How to quantify interference effects including timing behavior.Watch a practical demo on a T2080 multicore processor.

    RapiTestÂ gives you flexibility in writing your tests by providing three testing options: theÂ RapiTest EditorÂ format, which is integrated into the RapiTestÂ user-interface, aÂ spreadsheet formatÂ and aÂ scripting language. These have been designed to address the major drivers of inefficiency in test generation, andÂ provide a fast way to write complex butÂ easily readable tests.Â 


    If you have existing tests, we can help you convert them so you can run them with RapiTest. You can also convert your tests between RapiTestÂ formats, making it easier to get the most from your test authoring effort. As tests in the scripting format can include complex features, these cannot be converted into tests in other formats.


    RapiTest Editor format


    Create your tests directly in theÂ RVS Project ManagerÂ user-interface. This format guides you during test creation, helps you generate stubs and local test objects, and includes the richest error-checking functionality. Â 


    


    Â 


    Spreadsheet format


    Use a simple spreadsheet format to write and edit tests quickly. While easy to use, this format is powerful, letting you test inherited functions, stub sections of your source code and use local test objects.


    


    Â 


    Scripting language


    The RapiTest Scripting Language (RTS) is an advanced option that gives you access to RapiTest's most advanced testing techniques, and may be a good option for complex integrations.

If you run coverage analysis during active development, your code will often change. If you have applied RapiCover or RapiCoverZero justifications to mark your code as covered by analysis, this could require review of the justifications you have applied to ensure they are still valid. Manual review wouldÂ requireÂ considerable effort and is prone to error.

RapiCover and RapiCoverZero helpÂ you migrate your justifications to new builds. When the tools are confident that your existing justifications are still valid with the new build because, for example, the source file containing the function has not changed, the tools automatically migrate justifications for you. When they aren't confident of this, they attempt to locate the new code elementÂ that the justification was applied to, taking into account function renaming, changes to function structure or register addresses and function relocation. If the tools can locate this code, they highlight the old and new versions and suggest where to migrate the justification to, so it's as easy as the click of a button to do so after review.

For RapiCover, you can configure the strictness with which justifications are automatically migrated, for example to automatically migrate all justifications where the function that was justified has not changed between builds.

For RapiCover, this feature is qualifiable for use in DO-178B/C and ISO 26262 projects.

You can apply a single justification to multiple locations, reducing the effort involved in managing justifications in projects with many coverage holes of the same type.

When viewing a justification in the RVS Project Manager, you can add multiple locations, or âTargetsâ, associated with that justification. You can also use the right-click menu to apply an existing justification to any element in a table, or in the source code view.

For example, if you create a justification for an uncovered MC/DC condition in your code, you can apply the same justification to the whole branch, saving you time. In projects where the same piece of code is used multiple times in many different files and folders, you can create a single justification and apply it to all locations. This makes managing justifications easier, as well as more consistent and streamlined. Used together with other features, such as custom fields, templates and migrating justifications, multi-justifications reduce the overall effort needed for your testing project.

RapiCoverÂ and RapiCoverZero justifications letÂ you mark untestable code as covered by analysis. This lets you provide a rationale for why the code cannot be tested, such as it being defensive or on an infeasible path. You can attach files such as requirements to justifications so you can trace them back to requirements.Â 


Justifications are designed to reduce the effort needed for your testing project.Â You can store all of your justifications in the same location, such as a central server under version control. This lets multiple users use the same set of justifications so you don't have to create the same justification twice. You can create custom fields for your justifications, and use templates to write new justifications more quickly. You can also apply a single justification to multiple locations, reducing the effort involved in managing justifications in projects with many coverage holes of the same type.

RapiCoverÂ and RapiCoverZeroÂ helpÂ you toÂ migrate justifications when your source code changesÂ by identifying changes to the code and suggesting where justifications should be relocated afterÂ manual review. When code changes but these changes do not impact on a justification, it even migrates the justification automatically.

RapiCoverZero analyzes the structural coverage achieved when executable code is run, supporting structural coverage analysis when a project's source code is unavailable or can't be instrumented.

RapiCoverZero supports analysis of the following coverage metrics:


	Function
	Call
	Statement
	Branch/decision


To analyze structural coverage from program execution, RapiCoverZero uses information collected fromÂ branch traces generated by compatible hardware and combines this with extra information collected from a disassembly of the executable. This allows coverage to be analyzed without instrumentation of or even access to source code, and with no modification of the build system. For a list of compatible hardware, see RapiCoverZero's platform support.

On some platforms, RapiCoverÂ can alsoÂ report on decision coverage for conditional non-branch instructions.

If you're using RapiCover to collect coverage from instrumented source code, you can merge your RapiCover results with those from RapiCoverZero, for example to supplement your coverage results with MC/DC, which can't be collected by RapiCoverZero.

RVS can be used to verify multicore systems for requirements-based testing, structural coverage, execution time and scheduling behavior.

For zero footprint RVS tools such as RapiCoverZero, analysis of multicore systems is supported if the mechanism used to collect branch trace information allows you to record this information from multiple cores simultaneously.

Analysis of multicore software poses challenges not present for single core systems, particularly when analyzing execution time behavior due to non-determinism of software execution. As long-standing experts in execution time analysis, we provide a unique solution to verify the timing behavior of multicore systems.

RVS supports multicore timing analysis by supporting the generation of multicore test harnesses (through RapiTest), the collection and analysis of performance metrics from multicore systems (through RapiTime), and the analysis of task-level scheduling behavior (through RapiTask). It makes it easy to analyze the large quantity of results typical in multicore timing analysis projects by letting you filter your results to only show results of specific tests or metrics, letting you select a baseline test against which to compare differences, and letting you inspect the variability in results for each metric across your test scenarios.

Results such as coverage obtained from RapiCoverÂ or RapiCoverZero or your software's worst-case path (as calculated by RapiTime) are highlighted and color-coded to help you understand how your results map to specific areas of your code.

Within the code viewer, where they are available, you can view source code, preprocessed code, instrumented code and object code. If you're using a zero-footprint RVS tool such as RapiCover Zero and have access to source code and debug symbols, you can view your object code and source code side-by-sideÂ to support traceability of your results between the two.Â

    RapiTest helps you trace between your requirements-based tests and the requirements from which they were developed and track your requirements coverage.
    
    You can import requirements specified in multiple formats including Word, Excel, and the Requirements Interchange Format (ReqIF) format, which is a common format supported by many requirement management tools. After importing your requirements and linking them to your tests, RapiTest creates a traceability link between the artifacts. After running your tests, you can then identify your requirements coverage and test pass/fail status against each requirement from a dedicated Requirements page in your report. You can also export your traceability results in RapiTest exports.
    
    To provide an interface between RapiTest itself and requirements developed outside of RapiTest, RapiTest provides a requirements modeling tool that lets you import requirements and export requirements, test results and metadata.

RapiTimeZero analyzes the timing behavior of executable code while it is run, supporting timing analysis when a project's source code is unavailable or can't be instrumented.

RapiTimeZero produces timing metrics including the following:


	Worst-case execution time
	Overall execution time per test
	Average execution time through all tests
	High-water mark execution time
	Contribution of each function's execution time to the overall execution time of the system


To analyze timing behavior from program execution,Â RapiTimeZeroÂ uses information collected fromÂ branch traces generated by compatibleÂ hardware and combines this with extra information collected from a disassembly of the executable. This allows timing behavior to be analyzed without instrumentation of or even access to source code, and with no modification of the build system. For a list of compatible hardware, see RapiTimeZero's platform support.

It's easy to view your results with theÂ RVS Project Manager, which lets you compare results from various stages in your project so you can track progress over time.

  You can run RVS automatically through the Jenkins continuous integration server. This lets you ensure that your verification results stay up-to-date throughout your project's entire life cycle.
  
  After setting up an integration betweenÂ RVSÂ and Jenkins,Â a detailed RVSÂ report is stored every time a build runs on the Jenkins CI server. The results are added to your project's history, letting you see the trend in your project's unit tests and the structural coverage and timing behavior of your code over time. If you've linked your unit tests to requirements, you can also track your requirements coverage over the course of your project.
  
  Using these trends, you can easily identify which revision of your source code caused unit test failures, coverage holes or spikes in your software's worst-case execution time (WCET), so you can fix problems as they occur.

  RVS also supports continuous verification with the Bamboo ALM tool.Â

RVS has flexible licensing options, letting you get the most from the software depending on your needs. These options support the use of RVS in both small and large companies alike:


	Floating licenses makeÂ it easy for multiple peopleÂ within an organization to use the software in a sharedÂ environment such as a shared server, thin client system orÂ virtual machine.
	Node-locked licensesÂ letÂ you use RVS onÂ a machine that a USB dongle is plugged into. You can install RVS on multiple machinesÂ and switch the machine you're using RVS on by moving the USB dongle to the new machine.Â Â 


You can license RVS for a duration that suits you:


	If you're using RVS for a short duration, you can license the software on anÂ annual basis
	If you're going to use RVS for years to come,Â a perpetual license may be the best optionÂ

        A node-locked license lets you use RVS on a specific machine (node). Licenses are tied to a machine using either digital or physical license keys. We support migration of node-locked licenses from one node to another on request if there is a valid reason for the migration.
            
    
    
        With a node-locked license, you cannot install RVS on shared user machines, thin clients, systems that use remote desktop, or servers, nor use it in continuous integration environments. If you want to use RVS on these systems or environments, you can use a floating license, which you can upgrade to at any time.

RapiCoverÂ calculates the following types of coverage achieved by software tests:


  Function
  Call
  Statement
  Branch/decision
  Modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC)

These terms are described in detail in our white paper on the eight top code coverage questions in embedded avionics systems.

RapiCoverÂ supports advanced MC/DC analysis includingÂ masking of MC/DC conditions, analysis of decisions with up to 1000 conditionsÂ and configurable use of either CAST-10 literal or traditional definitions.

RapiCover's efficient analysis engine and integrationÂ workflow reduceÂ the effort you need to obtain coverage results. Coupled with the ease of automating testingÂ to occur during your regular builds, you'll be producing coverage data faster than ever.

It's easy to view your results with the RVS Project Manager, which lets you compare results from various stages in your project so you can track progress over time. This application also lets you filter your results based on the folders, files and functions in your project as well as individual test runs that you can specify with RapiCover.Â Â

If you use a modified compiler or language standard, the Cext Editor makes it easy to manage compiler extensions. It has many useful features including syntax highlighting, auto-completion, diff highlighting, and error messages for syntax errors. You can also enter sample code, and test your Cext file against it.

When you change your code, running a full test run is expensive. To reduce overall costs, you may want to ensure that your tests still achieve the same coverage they did previously before you commit to a full test run.

The Optimal Dataset Calculator helps you reduce the cost of checking your code's coverage before committing to a full test run. By calculating the optimal set of tests required to achieve maximum coverage, and helping you to select any RapiTest tests that contribute to your coverage, the Optimal Dataset Calculator lets you focus your testing effort and avoid running unnecessary or redundant tests. A helpful wizard guides you through configuring the cost of each test (either by test duration or another relevant metric such as engineer hours) and defining the functions, files and folders for which you want to achieve coverage.

When testing your code for structural coverage, you'll typically run large batteries of tests, including system, integration and unit tests. RapiCover makes it easy to manage these tests, letting you assign tests to specific datasets.

When you've assigned tests to datasets, you can easily filter your coverage results to only show those achieved from specific datasets in the RVS Project Manager, and calculate the minimum set of tests you need to achieve maximal coverage by using the Optimal Dataset Calculator.

If you're using RapiTest to run functional tests, all of your tests are automatically assigned to a dataset, so you can easily filter your results.

By letting you verify the behavior of your software through direct analysis of object code, zero-footprint RVS toolsÂ supportÂ verification use casesÂ commonly encountered in critical software development such as the need to verify third party softwareÂ or software with little remaining space for instrumentation.Â Â 

To support this, zero-footprint RVS toolsÂ reconstructÂ information on softwareÂ execution behavior by using branch trace information collected when running it on the targetÂ hardwareÂ along with a disassembly of the application.

The recommended strategy to integrate instrumentation-based RVS tools with a development is to use a compiler wrapper. This is an executable that intercepts some calls to your compiler to let RVS observe your source code and inject RVS code into a copy of it.

Using this strategy, it is necessary to make few, if any changes to the build system, and an integration can be configured in seconds. This strategy can only be used when a wrapperÂ is available for your compiler.

RVS tools are designed to easily integrate with existing build systems, even ones that apply and run tests on complex embedded targets. After integrating with a build system, RVS can run it to produce verification data.

Integration strategies are flexible, andÂ do not add unnecessary overheads to your build process. For example, by using a compiler wrapper (available for mostÂ development environments), running your build system can be as simple as calling this instead of your regular compiler. Â 

For information on some of the systems that RVS has been used on, see the RVS support specification.

To help you refine the analysis applied to specific sections of your source code, the RVS Project Manager displays the structure of your code graphically, making it easy to configure your analysis in context.

Using the standard workflow for RVS, integrations to use the tool within a development environment can be configured quickly and easily.

In this workflow, integrations are carried out in separate stages. In each stage, a series of scripts runs that can be customized to meet the needs of the project. In theÂ CleanÂ stage of an integration, for example, a command such asÂ  make cleanÂ is run to clean intermediate files in the integration. You only need to configure these scripts onceÂ during your project, and this is easy to do using theÂ RVS Project Manager.Â Â 

In the RVSÂ workflow, static analysis is run (during theÂ PrepareÂ stage) before dynamic analysis is (during theÂ RunÂ stage). After applying most analysis settings toÂ configure your analysis, it is not necessary to rerun static analysis.Â This means that static analysis often needs to be run only once during a project, reducing overallÂ testing time.

When statically analyzing C and C++ code, RVSÂ keeps track of the source files it has analyzed. If any changes are made to these files, you only need to rerun static analysis on new or changed files, hence reducing the impact of code changes on your overall verification effort.

In some cases, when collecting system event traces, you may not be able to instrument the individual tasks in a system, or may not want toÂ so that you can collectÂ results in fewer builds on resource-constrained targets.

RapiTask lets you collect event traces without instrumenting individual tasks.Â By instrumenting only your operating system's context switch routine, you can still collect execution time data for each taskÂ in your code.Â 

For an example, see our blog.

RapiTask automates the collection of timing metrics while multithreaded applications run on their target hardware.Â 

Producing results in an easy-to-digest format, RapiTaskÂ measures system-level properties such as periodicity and jitter and helps you to understand scheduling behavior, locate rare timing events and analyzeÂ capacity issues in your system.

With flexible integration strategies, RapiTask can be used on almost any hardware, including multi-core systems.Â Â  Â

To meet the ever-increasing demands of modern embedded systems, many such systems have limited resources such as code size andÂ CPU utilization,Â limiting the amount of instrumentation that can be applied to the code to test it's timing behavior.Â 

RapiTime's analysis is configurable, making it easier to produce an executable that meets the resource constraints of your system.

As well as letting you manually select which functions to instrument, and what level of instrumentation to apply to them, RapiTimeÂ includes a time bands feature that lets you semi-automate the selection of instrumentation based on the expected execution frequencies of functions in your code.

When using time bands, refinement rules let you reduce or omit instrumentation in functions that don't require detailed timing information.

RapiTime collects or calculates the following types of execution time data from software tests run directly onÂ embedded hardware:


	Overall execution time per test
	Average execution time through all tests
	High-water mark execution time
	Worst-case execution time
	Contribution of each function's execution time to the overall execution time of the system


RapiTime's efficient analysis engine and integrationÂ workflow reduceÂ the effort you need to obtain timing results. Coupled with the ease of automating testingÂ to occur during your regular builds, you'll be producing timing data faster than ever.

It's easy to view your results with the RVS Project Manager, which lets you compare results from various stages in your project so you can track progress over time. This application also lets you filter your results based on the folders, files and functions in your project.Â Â

When you run large batteries of tests on your code, it's helpful to know which of your tests covered each element in your code. This information could help you perform codeÂ change analysisÂ and, during early development, help you easily update existing tests to cover uncovered elements inÂ your code.

RVS helps you identify which of your tests cover each element in your source code, whether these are functional tests written inÂ RapiTestÂ or RapiCoverÂ datasets.Â From theÂ RVS Project Manager, simply right-clicking on an element anywhere inÂ your report, including the source code view,Â lets you export this data.

With this information, when you update your code, it's easy to identify which tests you need to re-run, so you can run only these tests again, thereby reducing the effort needed to review your changes.

If, during early development, you identify areas of your code that are missing structural coverage, you can identify the tests that hit nearby elements in your code and update these to test the element.Â

For certification of DO-178B/C software, source code must typically be tested to achieve 100% MC/DC coverage.Â This means that you must supply MC/DC vectors to test that every condition has been tested and shown to affect the outcome of the decision.

RapiCover highlights MC/DC vectors missing from each condition, helping you generate tests to address missing coverage.Â When highlighting missing test vectors, RapiCoverÂ appliesÂ masking MC/DCÂ (asÂ recommended for DO-178 projects in CAST-6), reducing theÂ overhead of analysis so you can fit more tests on each build and collect your results in fewer builds.

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="The RTBx automatically timestamps verification data that it collects. This removes the need to configure a timestamping procedure on the embedded target itself, which would incur code size and execution time overheads.

Compared to other hardware that can be used for timestamping such as debuggers and logic analyzers, the RTBx can collect trace data for far longer, meaning that it doesn't become a bottleneck in your testing.Â Â 

You can use the RTBx's 64-bit on-board clock to timestamp data, even when it is produced at extremelyÂ high rates. Because the RTBx has a single clock, there's no need to worry about timing inconsistencies caused by systems with multiple clocks, such as multi-core systems. This makes it an excellent way of collecting data for use with RapiTask.

Alternatively, you can synchronize the RTBx with clocks on your embedded hardware to collect data when your hardware reports that it has been output.Â To ensure that data is ready before it is collected, the RTBx lets you set a delay, and you can configure it to collect data on the rising or falling edges of clock signals, or both.

These include worst-case execution time, the high water mark path, and minimum, average and maximum execution times for each test of your code.Â 

You can also configure RapiTime to collect additional measurements between any points in your code. This allows you to collect measurements such as response times, periodicity and separation.

<a class="linktocontent" data-body="As with all RVS tools, RapiTimeÂ supports data collection on multicore architectures.Â RapiTimeÂ achieves this by suspending data collection during a task interrupt and reinitializing collection when the task on the current core resumes execution. You can also use RapiTimeÂ to identify the interference produced by other cores on your system under test.

RapiTime is a key component of Rapita's MACH178 solution and Multicore Timing Solution, which analyze the timing behavior of multicore systems.
